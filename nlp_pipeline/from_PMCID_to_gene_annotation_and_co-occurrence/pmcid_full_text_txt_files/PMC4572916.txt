 The Key Role of Calmodulin in KRAS-Driven Adenocarcinomas. K-Ras4B is a highly oncogenic Ras isoform and is the only isoform associated with initiation of adenocarcinomas. Mechanistic insight into why and how K-Ras4B mediates ductal adenocarcinomas, particularly of the pancreas, is vastly important for its therapeutics. The current review points out the overlooked but critical role of calmodulin (CaM) which selectively binds to GTP-bound K-Ras4B; but not to its isoforms. Cell proliferation and growth require the MAPK (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. We propose how Ca2+/CaM promotes PI3K/Akt signaling and how Ca2+/CaM involvement explains enigmatic observations like the elevated calcium levels in adenocarcinomas. We hypothesize that CaM recruits and activates PI3K at the membrane, and that this is the likely reason for Ca2+/CaM-dependence in adenocarcinomas. CaM contributes to initiation and progression of many ductal cancers (e.g., pancreatic, colorectal, lung) via both PI3Kalpha/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. Therefore, blocking the K-Ras/MAPK pathway and CaM/PI3Kalpha binding in a K-Ras4B/CaM/PI3Kalpha heterotrimeric complex has promising clinical potential as an adenocarcinoma-specific therapeutic strategy. Introduction. RAS signaling cascades are still not entirely understood. Cell decisions are temporal, and functions typically involve more than one pathway. Growth and proliferation, which require both the mitogen-activated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, provide a compelling example. Under normal physiological conditions, PI3Kalpha is recruited to the membrane by activated tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or adaptor proteins. When K-Ras4B is constitutively activated by mutations, calmodulin (CaM) can act to accomplish the full activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway role. K-Ras4B is the only Ras isoform or splice variant to bind CaM; we propose that by activating the PI3Kalpha/Akt pathway in the absence of a growth cue, CaM plays a critical role in adenocarcinomas, particularly pancreatic cancer. The high calcium levels observed in adenocarcinomas may explain CaM's involvement in recruiting and activating PI3Kalpha through interaction with its n/cSH2 domains as well as K-Ras, and why K-Ras4B specifically is a key player in these cancers. CaM's role in recruiting PI3Kalpha essentially makes it act as a Ca2+-regulated scaffolding protein. Based on genetically-engineered mouse models, even in the absence of RTK signal, oncogenic mutations in K-Ras can lead to oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) or to proliferation and differentiation; however, on their own, oncogenic mutations in K-Ras4B are unable to achieve full PI3Kalpha activation. Thus, a compelling question is whether in addition to the mutations, there exists another factor. Possible factors include elevated levels of CaM/Ca2+, a redundant pathway, bypassing PI3Kalpha-dependent growth, and PI3Kalpha mutations. The first two can be cell/tissue-specific. A K-Ras4B/CaM/PI3Kalpha trimer fits available experimental and clinical data, is able to explain the high frequency of oncogenic K-Ras4B in adenocarcinomas, particularly in pancreatic cancer, and is a promising, highly specific therapeutic venue for adenocarcinoma. Ras isoforms, mutations and cancer. Ras proteins regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, migration and apoptosis. H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B are highly homologous in sequence (~80%). They are distinguished mostly by their C-terminal hypervariable regions (HVRs). They are preferentially located at different membrane microdomains and are not functionally redundant. KRAS oncogene has been implicated in malignancies of the lung, pancreas and colon. Activating KRAS mutations, are present in ~90% of the cases of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the predominant form of pancreatic cancer. The KRAS oncogene is mutated in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers. Oncogenic KRAS has also been implicated in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). PDAC is complex and heterogeneous and the key mutations may differ. It is largely driven by the K-Ras4B splice variant of the KRAS gene. Distinct signaling pathways in KRAS-driven adenocarcinomas. Oncogenic K-Ras signaling in PDAC is complex and dynamic. It involves three major pathways: Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Pdk1/Akt and the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RalGEFs). PDAC initiation, progression and maintenance depend on K-Ras/PI3K/Pdk1/Akt signaling. This is supported by treatment of primary acinar cells from human pancreas with PI3K/Pdk1/Akt pathway inhibitors. Like K-RasG12D-driven PDAC, pancreas-specific expression of PIK3CAH1047R (p110alphaH1047R, a constitutively active oncogenic class IA phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), selectively activates the PI3K/Pdk1/Akt pathway, indicating that the constitutively-activated pathway can induce acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, pancreatic intraepithelial lesions (PanIN) and PDAC; inactivation of Pdk1 blocked tumor development and progression, confirming the key involvement of PI3K pathway activation in K-Ras driven PDAC, although these findings are in contrast to Raf/MEK/ERK being considered as the dominant signaling pathway. Activation of the MAPK pathway can drive pancreatic neoplastic changes, indicating that both pathways operate in adenocarcinoma development. Mutant RalGEFs are important Ras effectors particularly in KRAS-driven PDAC and colon cancers, and are consistently highly activated in pancreatic tumors. RalA acts in earlier- and RalB in later- PDAC stages. The two mutant isoforms reflect compensatory short-term versus prolonged loss of Ral function. In colorectal tumor cells, loss of one Ral isoform increases GTP loading of the other. K-Ras exploits different downstream effectors or isoforms in PDAC and NSCLC. The contribution of B-Raf to K-Ras-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis is unclear; C-Raf is required in K-RasG12D-driven NSCLC, but apparently has no role in KRASG12D-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis. K-RasG12D-driven PDAC requires PI3K/Pdk1/Akt signaling; KRASG12D-driven NSCLC is unaffected by loss of Pdk1, suggesting differential activation of the PI3K/p110 isoform in NSCLC. In support of this, earlier pharmacological studies on PDAC and NSCLC observed tissue-specific differences in K-Ras signaling. Although abolishing the K-Ras/PIK3CA interaction significantly diminished K-Ras-driven NSCLC in vivo, class IA PI3K inhibitor or p110alpha isoform-specific inhibitor alone were only mildly effective; when combined with a MEK1/2 inhibitor, the tumor size decreased significantly. In contrast, in pancreatic cancer, a class IA PI3K inhibitor reduced considerably tumor progression in K-RasG12D-driven PDAC in vivo. RTK signal-activation in K-Ras mutant tumors also differed: unlike the inhibitory effect of K-RasG12D-driven PDAC initiation by EGFR deletion, no effect was observed in K-RasG12D-driven NSCLC. Thus, similar to B-Raf-driven melanoma and colon cancer which differ in their response to targeted therapies, K-Ras signaling in NSCLC and PDAC also differ, indicating the need for adenocarcinoma-specific treatment. Below we suggest that the difference lies in the involvement of K-Ras4B splice variant, whose farnesylated HVR is uniquely regulated by Ca2+-bound CaM in ductal adenocarcinomas. CaM could be the missing key to understand K-Ras4B MAPK and PI3K/Pdk1/Akt pathway regulation. Calmodulin/Ca2+ modulate specifically the activation of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways by K-Ras4B in ductal adenocarcinomas. Calmodulin (CaM), a small Ca2+-binding protein, acts in signal transduction in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, survival, and motility through association with CaM-binding proteins. CaM plays key roles in processes in cancer biology and associated signaling pathways. Recent evidence suggests that Ca2+/CaM selectively modulate K-Ras4B signaling. Unlike other isoforms, GTP-loaded K-Ras4B can interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In fibroblasts, CaM binding temporally down-regulates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and up-regulates the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway (Fig. 1). Farnesylated HVR is required for CaM's isoform-selective actions. Though the HVR is CaM's primary binding site with the farnesyl docked into CaM's hydrophobic pocket, HVR's inability to fully mimic the CaM/K-Ras4B1-188 interactions suggests catalytic domain involvement. CaM down-regulates the ERK1/2 pathway at low serum concentration; CaM's inhibition preferentially activates the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways are often deregulated in cancer. Mutations in genes that encode components of these pathways occur at high frequency. Mutations in Ras genes affect both. KRAS is altered in ~90% of human PDAC cases, 50% of colorectal cancers and 30% of lung cancers. The fact that constitutive activation of the K-Ras causes adenocarcinomas through these two major pathways points to Ca2+/CaM involvement. CaM enhances cell proliferation. Highly sustained activation of the ERK pathway induces overexpression of p21cip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1, which in turn leads to growth arrest of the cells, while transient activation followed by a sustained but lower level of ERK activity induces cell proliferation in many systems. CaM prevents a too-sustained ERK1/2 activation and cell proliferation upon growth factor stimulation and promotes growth through the Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway. The data above together with the observation that CaM is upregulated in many cancers including colorectal and lung adenocarcinomas support CaM's key role in cancer initiation and progression. Considerable data also support the involvement of calcium in adenocarcinomas. S100 calcium binding protein P (S100P), a Ca2+ binding protein associated with the progression of several cancer types including pancreatic, prostate, non-small cell lung, breast, and colorectal has been implicated in migration, invasion, proliferation and survival of cancer cells in vitro and increased tumor growth in vivo. Up-regulation of S100P is an early event in pancreatic cancer development and its expression increases throughout the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. S100P was observed in 95% of the cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. S100P-containing staining patterns are suggestive of PDAC, and S100P was proposed a promising diagnostic marker in pancreatic cancer screening. S100P binds and regulates IQGAP1 as does CaM. Akt is also IQGAP1's partner as are many others. IQGAP1 is known to induce EGF-stimulated Akt-mediated proliferation. Regulation of Ca2+ responses influences migration of pancreatic cancer cells. The relationship between Ca2+ and adenocarcinomas has even led to the suspicion that excess cytosolic calcium can be associated with the disease, a hypothesis that recently has been proven groundless. Blocking some calcium channels resulted in anti-proliferative action of adenocarcinomas and inhibition or knockdown of calcium release-activated calcium modulator Orai3 channel reduced store operated calcium entry and inhibited cell proliferation lung adenocarcinoma. Elevated Ca2+ levels in ovarian adenocarcinoma cells reduced proliferation as compared to other tumor types. A growing body of evidence in the literature indicates that CaM is upregulated in ductal cancers. As we noted above, CaM binding to K-Ras4B promotes the two characteristics of cancer: cell proliferation and migration via the MAPK and Akt pathways. Taken together, these results suggest a role for CaM in the initiation and progression of pancreatic, colorectal and lung cancers in agreement with the body of clinical data of high Ca2+ in K-Ras4B-dependent cancers. CaM temporally forestalls Raf and MAPK and promotes PI3K/Akt activation, proliferative signaling and cell migration. Below, we outline a possible mechanism for the modulation of the Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways by CaM/K-Ras4B. Liao et al. suggested that ternary complex formation between K-Ras4B, CaM and PI3K p110 might lead to an increase in the activity of Akt. This can be the case for the p110gamma isoform. PI3Kalpha is more likely to bind CaM through p85 SH2 domains (Fig. 1), absent in PI3Kgamma as indeed observed by Joyal et al.. A structural view supports calmodulin's involvement in adenocarcinomas. Direct physical interaction between Raf kinase and signal-activated Ras promotes Raf side-to-side dimerization and Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation. Ras is believed to function as a monomer; however, since signaling requires Raf's dimerization, it has been suspected that Ras also dimerizes. Binding of active Ras dimers to Raf monomers recruits the Raf/14-3-3 complex to the plasma membrane and induces conformational changes that initiate molecular rearrangements and multiple phosphorylation events, which in turn enhance Ras/Raf binding and stabilize Ras-mediated Raf activation. Ca2+-dependent CaM/K-Ras4B binding can promote K-Ras4B dissociation from the membrane, affect Raf's recruitment and interfere with K-Ras dimerization. Our structural analysis suggests two possible major interface classes for K-Ras4B homodimerization: beta-sheet (at the switch I and effector binding region) and helical (primarily alpha3 and alpha4) interfaces. Raf's dimerization is likely if K-Ras4B dimerizes through the helical interface (Fig. 2). High affinity CaM binding to the farnesylated hypervariable region (HVR) may prevent recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane and down-regulate Raf's activation (Fig. 1). Presumably, only a small fraction of the active K-Ras4B binds CaM, allowing a low level of Raf activity. Experiments with K-Ras4B-negative fibroblasts indicate that Akt growth factor-dependent cell migration and activation requires K-Ras4B. The inability of K-Ras4A or oncogenic N-Ras to restore K-Ras4B function in these cells suggests the involvement of a unique binding partner. The only known protein that fits this description is CaM. Cells treated with CaM antagonists phenocopied the biological outcomes of K-Ras4B-negative cells, failed to activate Akt and induce migratory response through matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) expression. MMP-2 is involved in the breakdown of type IV collagen and induces cell detachment, migration, and metastasis of invasive tumors. MMP-2 levels are elevated in breast, brain, ovarian, pancreas, colorectal, bladder, prostate and lung cancers and melanoma. Treating cells with PI3K or Akt inhibitors confirmed that the transcriptional activity of the MMP-2 gene is specifically controlled by K-Ras4B through a PI3K/Akt-dependent signaling pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that the K-Ras4B/CaM complex along with Ca2+ is the driving force behind growth factor-dependent Akt activation and that the PI3K/Akt pathway is essential for migratory activity. The fact that the K-Ras4B/CaM complex and PI3K are involved in Akt activation and the observation that CaM can directly activate PI3K, support the notion of a ternary complex between K-Ras4B, CaM, and PI3Kalpha suggested by Liao et al., albeit not necessarily with p110. Exploiting the powerful template-based protein-protein complex structure prediction algorithm PRISM, we modeled the binary interactions of PI3K p110alpha catalytic subunit with GTP-loaded K-Ras4B, and the Ca2+/CaM interaction with the PI3K p85alpha cSH2 domain, in agreement with the earlier indications from Joyal et al. experiments. A possible model of a ternary complex between K-Ras4B, CaM, and PI3K p110/p85 is shown in Fig. 3. CaM's binding to the cSH2 and nSH2 domains of p85 are more stable than to p110 and is in line with PI3K activation scenario, as detailed below. While the model may not reflect accurately the interaction details, it nevertheless not only supports the idea of ternary complex formation, but also indicates that CaM may indeed have a key function in Akt activation. Activated Ras can directly bind p110 and activate PI3K; however, the dissociation constant, KD, for the Ras-PI3K complex is higher than the 160 nM KD for the Ras-Raf RBD complex and the 1 muM KD for the Ras-Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS) RBD complex indicating that the Ras-binding domain of PI3K p110 has a relatively lower affinity for Ras. This suggests a significant role for CaM in ternary complex formation and PI3K activation. CaM binding might allosterically induce a conformational change in the RBD of PI3K in a way that cooperatively increases the affinity of K-Ras for PI3K, extending the duration of PI3K/Akt signaling. The low binding affinity of p110/K-Ras4B and the catalytic enhancement (8~10 fold) of p110 by GTP-bound K-Ras highlight the importance of membrane localization of p110alpha via p85 nSH2 domain binding to the phosphorylated tyrosine of RTKs (or GPCR or cytokine receptors for p110gamma) or their associated adaptor proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography suggested that CaM/Ca2+ binds p85; this was further affirmed by CGS9343B, a calmodulin antagonist that inhibited basal and Ca2+-stimulated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol in intact cells. While no direct affinity measurements are available, we expect that CaM/Ca2+ bind to the cSH2-p85 with much higher affinity than to the nSH2-p85. The phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) peptide KKHTDDGYMPMSPGVA (residues 605-615) with the pYXXM motif can disrupt the cSH2/CaM/Ca2+ binding. CaM stimulates PI3Kalpha phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) to PtdIns-3-P or PtdIns-4-P; but not PtdIns-4,5-P2 to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. In the Joyal et al. experiment, a concentration of 2 and 5 muM CaM with 100 muM Ca2+ in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line showed only 10% and 50%, respectively, stimulation of PI3K activity. These data imply that CaM might only have a high muM affinity to cSH2. We modeled the interaction of CaM with PI3Kalpha's nSH2 and cSH2 domains, and simulated the CaM/cSH2 interaction. The stability of CaM/Ca2+/cSH2 interaction was tested with flexible and stiff linker; both bound CaM states are stable throughout the simulation (unpublished observation). The nSH2 interaction will be tested as well. PI3Kalpha activation mechanism. To obtain clues to the structural activation mechanism we superimposed common structural entities in six known PI3K crystal structures, and built a structural model of the PI3Kalpha heterodimer. As depicted in Fig. 4, the model presents all five domains of the p110alpha catalytic subunit associated with the three p85alpha nicSH2 domains of the regulatory subunit. Also included in the structural model are components indispensable for the structural analysis of PI3Kalpha activation mechanism, including GNP-bound H-Ras bound at RBD, a co-substrate ATP bound in the cleft between the N- and C- lobes of the catalytic kinase domain, two of the phosphorylated peptides bound respectively to nSH2 and cSH2, as well as the head of lipid substrate PIP2 at the entrance of the active site. As in protein kinases, the lipid kinase activity of PI3Kalpha is affected by the efficiency of individual steps during the catalytic reaction, including co-substrate (ATP) binding, substrate (PIP2) binding, phosphoryl transfer and product (ADP and PIP3) release. If we assume that both the co-substrate binding and the product release steps do not play a significant role in PI3Kalpha activation regulation, then the kinase activation can be assessed by the kinetic measurement of ka/Km based on a two-step chemical reaction. ka, the rate constant of the slow phosphate transfer reaction, is inversely proportional to the free energy barrier of the transition state of the phosphate transfer complex. Km, the equilibrium constant of the fast substrate binding reaction, is inversely proportional to the binding affinity of substrate to PI3Kalpha. Studies of cellular as well as oncogenic mutations-elicited PI3Kalpha activation revealed two independent mechanisms. In the first, PI3Kalpha, an obligate p110alpha/p85alpha heterodimer in the cell, is activated by the binding of nSH2 domain to the pYXXM motif of activated RTKs or their associated adaptor proteins. The mutually exclusive binding of nSH2-p85alpha to p110alpha or to the pYXXM peptide, as shown in Fig. 4 indicates that the activation is through relieving the autoinhibition of p110alpha, which is impeded by the regulatory p85alpha. The inhibition role of the nSH2 domain is supported by oncogenic 'hot spot' mutations in the helical domain (E542K and E454K) which create same-charge repulsion replacing the highly favorable salt-bridge interactions with the nSH2 domain. In the second mechanism, PI3Kalpha activity is stimulated further by binding of the RBD to Ras-GTP in vivo and in vitro. The allosteric activation triggered by the Ras-GTP binding event seems to exert an effect similar to another oncogenic 'hot spot' (H1047R) in the kinase domain, causing conformational changes in the C-lobe of the kinase domain located at the membrane interface. Since both events are likely to result in increasing membrane binding to facilitate the accessibility of the kinase domain to the substrate PIP2 on the membrane surface, the H1047R mutant is independent of an interaction with Ras-GTP. In summary, the regulation of PI3Kalpha activity is controlled by two independent mechanisms: PI3Kalpha membrane binding capability and the population of effective phosphate transfer transition complexes at the active site. To facilitate the accessibility of the lipid substrate to the active site, evolution has structurally coupled the membrane binding capability of PI3Kalpha to its activation, as reflected in the Km. On the other hand, the release of nSH2-p85alpha domain from p110alpha, which relieves the restriction of an effective formation of phosphate transfer transition complex, may dominantly correspond to an increase of ka. Experimental data indicate that both activation events are required for PI3Kalpha to achieve a fully active lipid kinase. Future Prospects. Here we suggest that in PDAC, colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung adenocarcinomas, CaM/Ca2+ can regulate two major pathways, MAPK and PI3K/Akt. CaM/Ca2+ temporally down-regulates MAPK; it is required for full activation of PI3Kalpha by K-Ras4B. GTPase homologs activate PI3K through direct and indirect feedback processes; direct interaction of Ras with RBD-p110alpha is an absolute requirement for in vivo Ras-driven tumor formation. Endogenous oncogenic K-RasG12V triggers senescence alone, in the absence of RTK signaling. These facts indicate that different from physiological conditions, in cancer a fully activated PI3K pathway is required for cellular growth and proliferation. This leads us to reason that in adenocarcinomas, cell-specific up-regulation of CaM/Ca2+ expression may substitute for the missing phosphopeptide pYXXM signal from RTKs. CaM/Ca2+ can play two distinct activation roles: as an activator when bound to nSH2-p85alpha, or as an adaptor when bound to cSH2-p85alpha. For the first, the prediction of CaM/Ca2+ interacting with nSH2-p85alpha by PRISM suggests that CaM/Ca2+ can achieve full PI3Kalpha activation by relieving the p110alpha autoinhibition exerted by nSH2-p85alpha, via a steric hindrance mechanism similar to that induced by the pYXXM peptide (Fig. 4). For the second, CaM has been shown capable of dissociating K-Ras4B, but not its H-Ras or N-Ras isoforms, from membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner, with CaM's C-terminal domain binding its farnesylated HVR. Our modeling suggests that even when K-Ras4B dissociates from the membrane, CaM can fully activate PI3Kalpha via an allosteric mechanism. PRISM models a trimer, K-Ras4B-GTP/CaM/PI3Kalpha (Fig. 3), with an interaction between CaM and cSH2-p85alpha. CaM can act as an adaptor protein to increase the likelihood of K-Ras4B-GTP binding to RBD-p110alpha. In turn, the increase in membrane binding capability via an enhanced Ras binding environment allows PI3Kalpha to remain close to the plasma membrane without relying on K-Ras4B being anchored to membrane. In short, CaM can provide the critical missing link in K-Ras4B initiation and progression of pancreatic, colorectal and lung cancers. Insight into why and how K-Ras4B can mediate ductal adenocarcinomas, particularly of the pancreas, is vastly significant for adenocarcinoma-specific therapeutics. Here we pointed out the overlooked role of CaM in PI3K/Akt signaling. This is based on a wealth of literature and clinical observations and assisted by modeling which shows its feasibility. One way to test our thesis is by experimentally abolishing the K-Ras4B-GTP/CaM/PI3Kalpha trimer in mouse models or oncogenic K-Ras4B ductal cell lines. An inhibitor targeting CaM's interaction with p85alpha cSH2 domain is expected to affect PDAC initiation, cell proliferation and migration. However, since both MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways are involved, blocking MAPK signaling is also critical for successful treatment. Our model implies that the K-Ras4B-GTP/CaM/PI3K trimer can also serve as an allosteric drug target. Finally, to date CaM/K-Ras4B crystallization efforts failed. This could be due to the requirement of farnesylation; it can also reflect the multiple states of CaM/K-Ras4B-GTP catalytic domain interactions. Our findings suggest that crystallization efforts may benefit from consideration of a (farnesylated) K-Ras4B-GTP/CaM/PI3K trimer. Here we proposed that Ca2+/CaM play a key role in KRAS-driven adenocarcinomas by recruiting and activating PI3K at the membrane. We reasoned that CaM can act via both PI3Kalpha/Akt and Raf/MEK/ERK pathways and proposed that a K-Ras4B/CaM/PI3Kalpha trimer could be a propitious adenocarcinoma-specific therapeutic strategy. Our suggestion is in agreement with currently available data; however, ultimately, direct experimental validation is what is needed.            Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest         .

Calmodulin (CaM) binding to K-Ras4B-GTP downregulates the Raf/MAPK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Raf/MEK/ERK) pathway and allows a proliferative effect through inducing the expression of cyclin D1, a G1/S-specific cyclin, which is essential for cell cycle progression. Cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) complex phosphorylates and inhibits retinoblastoma (RB) protein and regulates G1/S transition. Binding of CaM to K-Ras4B-GTP activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (also known as protein kinase B, PKB) pathway and enhances cell migration through inducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) which breaks down type IV collagen, a major structural component of basement membranes. Thus, MMPs play crucial roles in invasion and metastasis. Predicted tetrameric complex of K-Ras4B-GTP/Raf1-RBD. K-Ras4B-GTP homodimer interfaces (ice blue and pink) binds Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf1 monomers (green and yellow). Raf1 RBD is known to bind to Ras through the beta-sheet (at the switch I and effector binding region) interface (PDB ID: 4G0N). Thus, K-Ras4B can dimerize through the helical interface (alpha3 and alpha4) so that each K-Ras4B monomer can bind to Raf1 RBD and promote Raf dimerization and activation. To construct a model for the tetramer complex of Raf/K-Ras, we used PRISM, an efficient template-based algorithm. PRISM predicts the structures of protein complexes by utilizing the structural similarity between template experimental interfaces and target surfaces. Here, we obtained the structural data from the PDB. K-Ras catalytic domain has 10 structures in the PDB. They include GDP- and GTP-bound conformations. We used the GTP-loaded active K-Ras molecules in the Ras dimer predictions. A K-Ras4B-GTP/calmodulin/PI3Kalpha ternary complex model based on the prediction. We used the G-domain of K-Ras (166 residues), full length CaM (149 residues) and the p110 catalytic p85 regulatory subunits of PI3K as target proteins. Full length CaM has about 75 structures in the PDB. We considered only X-ray structures with <3.00 A resolution. In this way, we reduced the number of CaM structures to 43 with 71 chains in total. PI3K p110 catalytic domain has 4 isoforms, p110alpha, p110beta, p110gamma, and p110delta. We used the p110alpha and p110gamma structures in the PDB. We predicted models for the binary interactions between K-Ras and PI3K, and CaM and PI3K. We identified the contact regions using HotRegion. HotRegion is a database of predicted hot spot clusters. It identifies the regions that are important for the stability of protein complexes by using predicted hot spot residues, major contributors to the binding energy. Then, we built a model for the ternary complex based on the binary interactions and available literature data. (a) The detailed structure; (b) A simplified cartoon rendering for clarity. The structural model of p110alpha/nicSH2-p85alpha built from six PDB structures. The PDB codes are 4OVV (p110alpha/niSH2-p85alpha/diC4-PIP2), 1E8X (ATP/p110gamma), 1HE8 (HRas/p110gamma), 1H9O (cSH2-p85alpha/pYXXM), 2IUI (nSH2-p85alpha/pYXXM), and 2Y3A (p110beta/icSH2-p85). In the model built by simple superimposition based common structural entities, the active site of kinase domain were bound with ATP and diC4-PIP2. The tail of diC4 chains in PIP2 implicitly points to where the membrane should be. Also included in the constructed complex are the two phosphorylated peptides (with pYXXM motif) bound respectively to the nSH2 and cSH2 domains as well as an active GNP-bound HRas bound to RBD of p110alpha.
