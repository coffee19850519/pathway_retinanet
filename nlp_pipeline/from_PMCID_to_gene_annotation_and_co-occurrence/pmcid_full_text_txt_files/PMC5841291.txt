 Sotetsuflavone suppresses invasion and metastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells by reversing EMT via the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis, and offers insight into novel strategies for cancer treatment. Sotetsuflavone was isolated from Cycas revolute, which has excellent anticancer activity in the early stages. The present study aims to evaluate the anti-metastatic potential of sotetsuflavone in vitro. Our data demonstrated that sotetsuflavone inhibits metastasis of A549 cells, and EMT. This inhibition was reflected in the upregulation of E-cadherin, and downregulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail. Mechanistically, our study demonstrated that HIF-1alpha played an important role in the anti-metastatic effect of sotetsuflavone in non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cells. Sotetsuflavone not only mediated VEGF expression but also downregulated VEGF and upregulated angiostatin, and simultaneously affected the expression of MMPs and decreased MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression. More importantly, HIF-1alpha expression may be regulated by the inhibition of PI3K/AKT and TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB pathways. These results suggest that sotetsuflavone can reverse EMT, thereby inhibiting the migration and invasion of A549 cells. This process may be associated with both PI3K/AKT and TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB pathways, and sotetsuflavone may be efficacious in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. Introduction. Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 1.38 million new cases each year, and over one million deaths worldwide annually. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80-85% of lung cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of <15%. Although advancements have been made in chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the overall survival rate of patients has remained unchanged in recent years. In NSCLC patients, about 30% of patients have distant metastasis upon diagnosis, 50-60% of patients have distant metastasis during treatment, and eventually lung cancer metastasis can claim the lives of 80-90% of patients. Therefore, inhibition and prevention of metastasis is key to the treatment of NSCLC. Cycas revolute possess the function of reducing fever, preventing bleeding, and dissipating congestion. The chemical ingredients of C. revolute are mainly flavonoids. Sotetsuflavone was isolated from C. revolute in our laboratory. Early experimental studies revealed that sotetsuflavone can inhibit A549 cell growth, but its mechanism remains to be researched. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process of tumor invasion and metastasis. Such changes enhance tumor cell migration, metastasis, and establishment of distant secondary tumors. EMT is a dynamic and complex process inseparable from the interaction between multiple growth factors, protein molecules, transcription factors, and the pathways they regulate. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) plays an important role in tumor cell invasion, metastasis, immortalization, tumor angiogenesis, and cancer function. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) usually exists in the form of a p65-p50 dimer, and can induce transcription of related genes involved in immune responses, inflammatory responses, cell growth, development, division, and apoptosis. Angiogenesis and the adaptation of cells to hypoxia are key to the development of tumors. Hypoxia can promote angiogenesis factors, including increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), while also lowering angiogenesis inhibitory factors such as angiostatin. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important proteolytic enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane. Their structure, function, and regulatory levels are closely linked to tumor invasion and metastasis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is an important cytokine that participates in inflammation, and the dynamic balance of immune cells and tumor progression. NF-kappaB and STAT3 gradually become the core molecules involved in inflammatory-induced metastasis in a large number of molecular signaling pathways associated with inflammation and EMT. Snail is a transcription factor that can stimulate the occurrence of EMT, which is significantly upregulated in various tumors and inhibits the expression of E-cadherin. The reduction and deletion of E-cadherin expression can lead to the disappearance of cell polarity and decrease cell adhesion, and is an important marker of the processes involved in EMT. The expression of E-cadherin is negatively correlated with tumor invasiveness, and the disappearance of epithelial cell polarity is accompanied by an increase in the expression of mesenchymal cell markers vimentin, N-cadherin, and fibronectin. Accordingly, this contributes to the occurrence of EMT processes, leading to the initiation of metastasis. After tumor cell hypoxia, the expression of invasion-related proteins, such as snail, slug, fibronetin, and vimentin increased, while E-cadherin decreased. Moreover, the invasion ability of tumor cells was enhanced. The tumor was prone to distant metastasis and had a deeper depth of tumor invasion. The active phosphorylated NF-kappaB in the nucleus can bind to the promoter region of the Snail-1alpha gene via chromatin, which becomes the upstream activator of Snail-1alpha. TNF-alpha can be activated by the NF-kappaB pathway and induce snail expression. An imbalance in the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a key role in the formation and development of lung cancer, and the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway can activate the transduction of several downstream signals and promote the development of NSCLC. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of sotetsuflavone on the migration and invasion of human NSCLC cell line A549. We further explored the possible mechanism of sotetsuflavone against NSCLC and provided a new theoretical basis for the treatment of lung cancer with Chinese medicine. Results. Sotetsuflavone inhibited the migration and invasion of A549 cells. Sotetsuflavone inhibited migration and invasion of A549 cells. Based on the preliminary study, A549 cells were treated with 0, 32, 64, 128 mumol/L, and 10 mug/ml of CDDP for 24 h. a Wound-healing assay measured the migration ability changes. Original magnification x40. b Transwell-matrigel invasion assay measured changes in invasive ability. Original magnification x100. The results from three independent experiments were expressed as mean +- SD compared with the control group, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. Combined with pre-experimental basis and the results of migration and invasion experiments, we finally selected 24 h as the follow-up experimental treatment time. The subsequent experimental concentration adjusted to was 0, 64, and 128 mumol/L. The scratch test and Transwell invasion assay demonstrated that sotetsuflavone inhibited cell migration compared to the control group. The sclerosis width gradually increased, and sclerosis on both sides of the cell density gradually reduced. At the same time, the scratch-healing rate of the sotetsuflavone treatment group decreased gradually in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, the invasion ability of A549 cells treated with different concentrations of sotetsuflavone was also significantly decreased, which demonstrated a significant dose-dependent inhibition of A549 cell invasion (Fig. 1b).

HIF-1alpha mediates cell response to hypoxia, and HIF-1alpha protein overexpression has been reported in several solid tumors and their metastases. We detected HIF-1alpha expression by western blot and immunofluorescence assay and discovered that sotetsuflavone decreased HIF-1alpha expression (Fig. 3a, b). Sotetsuflavone inhibited VEGF and angiostatin expression. a Western blotting detection of VEGF protein expression.

HIF-1alpha can mediate VEGF expression, and VEGF is an important factor in promoting angiogenesis and participating in tumor angiogenesis. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that sotetsuflavone inhibited VEGF expression. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis further demonstrated that VEGF was downregulated in A549 cells treated with different concentrations of sotetsuflavone for 24 h. Angiostatin is an important angiogenesis inhibitory factor; we used the immunofluorescence assay to analyze the expression of angiostatin. Our results demonstrated that sotetsuflavone increased angiostatin expression. In combination with the results shown in Fig. 3, we concluded that sotetsuflavone could reduce VEGF expression and downregulate angiostatin expression by decreasing HIF-1alpha expression (Fig. 4a-c). Sotetsuflavone inhibited MMP-9 and MMP-13 expressions. a Results from western blotting in detection of the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-13 protein. Using the same sample lysates as used for Fig. 2a, another gel (gel D) was run, the blot was cut horizontally, and probed with anti-MMP-9 and anti-MMP-13.

HIF-1alpha can increase the expression of MMPs and thus promote the metastasis of malignant tumors. MMPs play an important role in tumor neovascularization, tumor cell infiltration, and metastatic foci formation. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis demonstrated that the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-13 was downregulated in A549 cells treated with sotetsuflavone (Fig. 5a). In addition, most of the MMP-9 and MMP-13 detected by the immunofluorescence assay were present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5b, c).

The data in the histogram represented the mean +- SD from three independent experiments (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). NF-kappaB and HIF-1 are related to both gene and protein levels, and it has been suggested that activation of NF-kappaB and HIF-1alpha can promote angiogenesis or tumor progression. Our results demonstrated that sotetsuflavone decreased both TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6a, b). Combined with snail expression in Fig. 2a, it was suggested that sotetsuflavone can inhibit the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway by downregulating TNF-alpha expression, which inhibited the stability of snail protein by making it easier to degrade and lose its regulation. Sotetsuflavone inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Sotetsuflavone inhibited PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. a Results from western blotting showing expression of PI3K and AKT protein.

Diagram of the proposed mechanism by which sotetsuflavone inhibited NSCLC A549 cell invasion and metastasis. Diagram of the proposed mechanism by which sotetsuflavone inhibits non-small-cell lung cancer A549 cell invasion and metastasis. Sotetsuflavone inhibited the invasion and metastasis of A549 cells by inhibiting EMT and angiogenesis. The anti-transfer effect of sotetsuflavone was mainly through downregulation of HIF-1alpha by the inhibition of PI3K/AKT and TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in A549 cells, adjusting the whole process. In conclusion, we demonstrated that EMT and angiogenesis play key roles in determining to what extent sotetsuflavone can inhibit the invasion and metastasis of NSCLC A549 cells. More importantly, we discovered that sotetsuflavone could reverse EMT, thereby inhibiting the migration and invasion of A549 cells. This process might inhibit both PI3K/AKT and TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling pathways, and downregulate HIF-1alpha expression. Therefore, HIF-1alpha may be a potential anticancer target for sotetsuflavone. Figure 8 describes this proposed mechanism. Discussion. Sotetsuflavone is a type of double flavonoid extracted from the stem and leaf of C. revolute, and has a strong inhibitory activity on DENV-NS5 RdRp. In preliminary work, we have demonstrated that sotetsuflavone can inhibit proliferation and induction of apoptosis in the anti-human lung cancer cell line A549. Based on previous work, we generated the hypothesis that sotetsuflavone could inhibit the migration and invasion of A549 cells by reversing EMT. In the present study, we discovered that sotetsuflavone can inhibit the migration and invasion of A549 cells (Fig. 1a, b). E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin are important marker molecules of EMT adjusted by snail. E-cadherin mediates cell adhesion and inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis, and tumor advancement is closely related to its deletion. The expression of N-cadherin in epithelial tissue changes the morphological and biological functions of epithelial cells and transforming epithelial cells into interstitial cells in the EMT process. Vimentin is the major intermediate filament protein found in mesenchymal cells, which regulates cell motility and proliferation, and its expression in epithelial tumors is associated with cell invasiveness. Studies have demonstrated that sulforaphane, quercetin, and other drugs can effectively inhibit EMT via inhibiting the transcription of snail. Therefore, this begs the question: do anti-transfer effects of sotetsuflavone cause this? By detecting EMT-related indicators, we demonstrated that sotetsuflavone inhibited the expression of snail. At the same time, sotetsuflavone significantly increased the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and downregulated the expression of interstitial markers N-cadherin and vimentin (Fig. 2a-c). This induced MET in cells, reducing the ability of tumor cell invasion, and was consistent with the reports of sulforaphane and other drugs. Therefore, these results suggest that sotetsuflavone can inhibit the migration and invasion of A549 cells by regulating EMT. HIF-1alpha is an oxygen-dependent transcription factor, and a hypoxic environment promotes the high expression of HIF-1alpha gene in tumor cells and plays an important role in tumorigenesis, development, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis. VEGF is the most powerful and specific tumor angiogenesis-promoting factor currently known. When VEGF is combined with endothelial cells, it can promote proliferation, migration, and growth of endothelial cells. VEGF is an important target gene of HIF-1alpha. A high expression of HIF-1alpha upregulates the expression of VEGF, while upregulation of HIF-1alpha expression can promote the formation of tumor angiogenesis. Additionally, it also plays a role in the growth, invasion, and metastasis of NSCLC cancer tissues, suggesting that blocking HIF-1alpha/VEGF pathway and inhibiting tumor angiogenesis is an effective anticancer treatment plan. Angiostatin is an isolated angiogenic inhibitor from tumor cells and has a strong inhibitory effects on angiogenesis that inhibit the proliferation and migration of tumor vascular endothelial cells, prevent angiogenesis, promote the primary animal tumor regression, and inhibit the formation of metastases. Therefore, sotetsuflavone should also inhibit tumor angiogenesis. As we predicted, sotetsuflavone can significantly decrease the expression of HIF-1alpha and VEGF in A549 cells and increase the expression of angiostatin (Figs. 3a, b and 4a-c). EMT can promote the secretion of MMPs from tumor cells, thereby degrading and destroying the ECM and causing tumor cells to invade and migrate from the primary site. Among them, MMP-9 is a kind of gelatinase in MMPs capable of degrading IV-type collagen in the ECM, which is involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. MMP-13 is in the central position of the MMPs' activation cascade and participates in the degradation of ECM. It also activates MMP-2 and MMP-9 to participate in the development, progression, and invasion of several tumors. We discovered that both MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression were downregulated by sotetsuflavone (Fig. 5a-c). Multiple signaling pathways are involved in the development and progression of tumors in which the PI3K/AKT pathway is an important factor for tumorigenesis. Both PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB pathways are involved in the regulation of HIF-1alpha. PI3K/AKT is frequently abnormally activated in several human malignancies, and is closely related to tumor recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, and has become a hot topic in tumor-targeting drug research. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates the expression of snail and induces the occurrence of EMT. We discovered that the expression of PI3K and AKT were downregulated after sotetsuflavone-treated A549 cells (Fig. 7a, b). In combination with previous results (Fig. 3a, b), it was suggested that the inhibition of HIF-1alpha expression by sotetsuflavone may be related to the inhibition of PI3K and AKT expression. TNF-alpha is an important inflammatory factor, and multiple lines of evidence point to the critical role of TNF-alpha in tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. TNF-alpha has been widely recognized as an important regulator of the tumor microenvironment. The TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB pathway plays an important role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We examined the effect of sotetsuflavone on the TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB pathway. Our results indicated that sotetsuflavone can downregulate TNF-alpha and inhibit the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway (Fig. 6a, b). Sotetsuflavone can inhibit epithelial interstitial transformation, invasion, and metastasis of lung cancer cells in A549 cells through both PI3K/AKT and TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB pathways. In summary, sotetsuflavone can inhibit the invasion, migration, and EMT of A549 lung cancer cells. Its mechanism may be involved with the inhibition of PI3K/AKT and TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB pathways (Fig. 8). Our results provide a new theoretical basis for the application of sotetsuflavone in molecular targeted therapy of lung adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods. Materials, reagents, and instruments.
