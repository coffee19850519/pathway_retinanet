Although work is at an early stage, several lines of evidence already suggest that CLCA proteins (particularly hCLCA1) may be master regulators of mucin gene expression in humans. We have gradually developed the proposal that the airway maintains a special program for host defense and that changes in this same program may lead to airway disease. The same argument can be made for mucus secretion. Thus, under normal circumstances a physiologic level of mucus production allows for mucociliary clearance of particulate matter from the airway and aids in defense against respiratory pathogens. However, if mucus secretion is excessive, it leads to airway obstruction and consequent dysfunction. In both normal and abnormal conditions, there appears to be an immune axis that drives cytokine production, and in turn, a downstream mechanism that translates the cytokine signal into mucin gene expression. In humans, this downstream mechanism features hCLCA1, the first member of a newly defined family of ‚Äúchloride channel calcium-activated‚Äù (CLCA) proteins in humans. It is possible that additional CLCA family members may mediate airway hyperreactivity, but this issue requires further study. In either case, the mechanism for how hCLCA1 might signal to cause mucin gene expression and mucous cell metaplasia is a goal of ongoing studies. Initial analysis of CLCA structure and function suggests that these proteins are secreted and cleaved into fragment polypeptides. We are particularly focused on defining the possibility that hCLCA1 is a secreted protein that is cleaved into an active polypeptide that in turn binds to a receptor on the cell surface and signals to activate mucin gene expression (). This scheme for hCLCA1 (and orthologous mClca3,5,6) control over epithelial behavior can be tested in isolated airway epithelial cells as well as mouse models and then in patients with mucous cell metaplasia due to asthma or COPD or other inflammatory airway diseases.

J Cell Biol. 2003 Nov 10;163(3):437-440.",2003.0,The cellular itinerary and fate of classical cadherins,Traffic control.,"The cellular itinerary and fate of classical cadherins. (A) Adherens junctions are assembled around classic cadherins. Their extracellular domains mediate homophilic cell‚Äìcell adhesion. The distal regions of their cytoplasmic tails bind Œ≤-catenin, which in turn binds Œ±-catenin. Œ± -catenin links the junction to the actin cytoskeleton via direct and indirect interactions. The juxtamembrane domain of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail binds proteins of the p120 family. (B) The surface expression of E-cadherin is one facet of a complex trafficking network. Upon delivery to the cell surface, classical cadherins may adopt either of two fates. Productive homophilic ligation and attachment to the cytoskeleton allows cadherins to be retained at the cell surface, supporting lateral clustering and assembly of cadherins into adherens junctions (red arrow). Alternatively, cadherins may be endocytosed. They then can either be trafficked back to the cell surface (via a post-Golgi recycling pathway) or ultimately targeted for degradation, at least in part via lysosomes. Cadherins delivered to the cell surface can thus derive either from newly synthesized material or via the recycling pathway. p120 appears to play a key gatekeeper function in determining the fate of cadherins after delivery to the surface.

Glutamine contained in culture medium is converted in the cells into glutamate and further in mitochondria into Œ±-ketoglutarate, intermediate of tricarboxylic acid cycle. Glutamate is also a source of proline required for collagen biosynthesis. This pathway of proline supply is sufficient to maintain high collagen biosynthesis rate. An addition of exogenous proline results in slight increase in collagen production. Glutamine deprivation from culture medium contributes to decrease in cellular proline content resulting in down-regulation of collagen biosynthesis. In such a condition, exogenous proline restores intracellular proline pool, providing substrate for collagen biosynthesis. The conversion of proline into glutamate is not significant due to low expression of proline oxidase (POX) in fibroblasts. This hypothesis is supported by proline-dependent regulation of HIF-1Œ± transcriptional activity. Translocation of HIF-1Œ± to nucleus is more pronounced in the absence of glutamine since Œ±-ketoglutarate induces HIF-1Œ± hydroxylation and ubiquitin dependent degradation.

Integrin signals have been well documented to include a pathway that leads to activation of Rac1 activity, such as through the p130Cas and Crk pathway. Such activation of Rac1 is closely related to plasma membrane ruffling and enhanced cell motility. Our results suggest that integrin signals also include a pathway that evokes a mechanism to down-regulate Rac1 activity at the cell‚Äìcell contact areas of the cell periphery, in which the presence of Fak and paxillin appears to be essential. Paxillin participates in efficient FA recruitment of Fak, and Tyr861 phosphorylation may be important for Fak function.

Chlorinations of aromatic substrates by 7¬∑Cl‚àí both on the ring as well in benzylic positions (if available) were possible with electron rich substrates (, entries 7,8,10,11) while xylene (entry 9) was inert even at 60 ¬∞C. This is consistent with an electrophilic delivery of Cl+ by B. In line with this is the observed regioselectivity in the chlorination of 4-methylanisole in its 2- and 4-position (entry 11) consistent with the reported reactivity of this substrate in electrophilic chlorinations., Equally, we propose that benzylic chlorinations in entries 6, 7, and 8 are a consequence of initial Cl+-delivery to the aromatic ring by B similar to the benzylic chlorination mechanism proposed Baciocchi and Illuminati for highly methylated arenes. For example, in the reaction of 7¬∑Cl‚àí with durene the initially formed intermediate B would electrophilically deliver Cl‚àí to the Œ±- and the Œ≤-position of the œÄ-system to form F and G (). While F then produces the ring chlorination product, G undergoes a Baciocchi-Illuminati sequence including deprotonation and 1,5-Cl-shift from H to form the benzylic chlorination product. The observed biases for aromatic over benzylic chlorination products in entry 7 (aromatic/benzylic = 3.5:1) and entry 8 (aromatic/benzylic = 12:1) compare reasonably well with those found in previously reported electrophilic chlorinations of durene (aromatic/benzylic = 5.9:1) and mesitylene with quantitative aromatic substitution.",/pmc/articles/PMC4116810/figure/F16/,PMC4116810,nihms266447f16.jpg
