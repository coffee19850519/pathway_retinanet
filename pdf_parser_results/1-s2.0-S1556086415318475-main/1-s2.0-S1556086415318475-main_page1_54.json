  "Figure_title": "Group performance status 0 to 2 and stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent NSCLC who were previously treated with erlotinib or geﬁtinib but failed treatment because of progression or drug intolerance. Patients with asymptomatic, stable brain metastases were eligible. Patients received intravenous cetuximab, 400 mg/m2, followed by weekly infusions of 250 mg/m2. Four weekly treatments constituted one cycle, and CT scans were per- formed every two cycles to document response. A designa- tion of partial response or SD required conﬁrmation as deﬁned by RECIST. All radiographs were centrally reviewed at Massachusetts General Hospital. All patients were required to have an available tissue sample for EGFR mutation testing, which was performed centrally at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amend- ments-certiﬁed laboratory and involved extraction of genomic material from parafﬁn-embedded tissue, followed by polymerase chain reaction ampliﬁcation and direct se- quencing of exons 19 and 21 as previously described.10 The trial used a Simon two-stage design, which en- rolled 18 patients in the ﬁrst stage of accrual. The trial was to proceed to enroll 28 evaluable patients if 1 or more response was observed in the ﬁrst group. This design provided a 57% chance of early termination if the true response rate was �3%. PFS (survival without disease progression or death) and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical trial protocol was approved and moni- tored by the local institutional review board at all sites, and all patients provided written informed consent. Data were compiled and analyzed centrally at Massachusetts General Hospital. "
