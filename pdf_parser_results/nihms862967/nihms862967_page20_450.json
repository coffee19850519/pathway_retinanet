  "Figure_title": "Figure 5.  Pharmacodynamic modulation of the PI3K pathway. Needle core tumor biopsies obtained  from patients at baseline and at steady state (cycle 1, between days 15-21) were fixed and  evaluated by reverse phase protein array for PI3K-Akt pathway markers. Decreases of >  60% in pAkt and pS6, and up-phosphorylation of BIM (pro-apoptopic protein) were  demonstrated in comparison to baseline for (A) patient 1 on 3 mg QD taselisib with paired  biopsies from right endobronchial mass and (B) patient 2 on 16 mg QD taselisib with paired  biopsies from right upper anterior thigh mass.
