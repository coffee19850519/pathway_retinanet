  "Figure_title": "Figure 4.  (A) Best FDG-PET response (mean percentage change in SUVmax). Partial metabolic  response was defined as greater than a 20% decrease in %ΔSUVmax. Patients with N/A (not  applicable) did not have subsequent scan after starting treatment. All patient data arranged in  (A) are in the same patient order as in as panels (B) and (C). (B) Best percent change from  baseline in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) for target lesions via RECIST v1.1 available  for 28 measurable patients with at least one post-baseline tumor assessment for target lesion  (from 29 patients with baseline measureable disease) out of 34 enrolled patients. (C)  Corresponding somatic mutation profiling in both tumor- and plasma-extracted DNA from  enrolled from patients. The patient with PIK3CA mutation type “PIK3CA Other” had an  R88Q mutation. "
