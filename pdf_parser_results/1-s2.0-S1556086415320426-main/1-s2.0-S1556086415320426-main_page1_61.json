  "Figure_title": "ing the promise of such an effort.8,9 These studies were mostly focused on early detection, diagnosis, staging, treat- ment monitoring, and prognosis of lung cancer.8–12 A few studies have reported proteomics analysis of radiation-in- duced changes in lung cells or tissue.13–15 We have previously demonstrated in animal studies that radiation-induced changes in multiple proteins differ between lung ﬁbrosis sensitive and resistant mouse strains by proteomic ap- proaches.16 Using ExacTag labeling, reverse-phase high-per- formance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and nano liq- uid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), we recently assessed differ- ential plasma proteomics in patients with and without grade �2 RILT (grade �2 radiation-induced lung toxicity [RILT2]) in 20 patients throughout the treatment course.17 We demon- strated that C4b-binding protein alpha chain (C4BPA), com- plement C3, and vitronectin (VTN) had signiﬁcantly higher expression levels in patients with RILT2 compared with patients without RILT2, based on both the longitudinal data sets of RT start to 3 months post-RT (p � 0.01) and RT start to the end of RT (p � 0.01). The purpose of this study, using a larger number of patients, was to examine whether there is any potential proteomic biomarkers at baseline (before radio- therapy start) to predict the risk of RILT2.
