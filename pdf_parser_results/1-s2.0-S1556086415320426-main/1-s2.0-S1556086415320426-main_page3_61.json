  "Figure_title": "5 to 8, whereas the reference protein AFM was detected at similar levels of expression, which are consistent with the results from proteomic approaches. This result suggests the reliability of the proteomic approaches used for protein quan- tiÔ¨Åcation. VTN in the samples from patients with RILT2 presents smear bands at higher molecular weight and sug- gesting greater glycosylation. "
