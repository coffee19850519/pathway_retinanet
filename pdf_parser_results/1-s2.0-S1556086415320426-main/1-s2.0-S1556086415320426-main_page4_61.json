C4BPA21–23 and VTN24–27 are glycoproteins, which play important roles in radiation-induced lung damage. The detailed functions of these proteins are complex and have been summarized previously.17 C4BPA seems to be mainly associated with the inﬂammatory complement pathway, whereas VTN is involved in the ﬁbrotic pathway. The high baseline level of these two proteins may suggest higher sensitivity of an individual to inﬂammatory or ﬁbrotic patho- genesis, thus putting this patient at a higher risk for RILT. Changes in abundance and alternations in glycan com- position of plasma proteins and cell-surface proteins have been shown to correlate with cancer and other disease states. In fact, numerous clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets are glycosylated proteins, such as CA125 for ovarian cancer and the prostate-speciﬁc antigen for prostate cancer. VTN is a glycoprotein with three N-glycosylation sites identiﬁed.28,29 Sano et al.20 reported that the changes in N-glycosylation of VTN modulate collagen binding during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. As shown in Figure 3, patients with RILT2 might have much higher levels of glycosylated VTN than patients without RILT2. Our future work will focus on glycoproteome analysis of human plasma to ﬁnd more de- tailed information on the glycoproteins, which may be poten- tial biomarkers for RILT2. To reveal the association between our identiﬁed pro- teins and the known pathways for radiation-induced lung damage, we used ingenuity pathway analysis, a knowledge- based system derived from the literature containing informa- tion on interactions between genes, proteins, and other bio- logical molecules, to reveal the associated biological pathways and generate global canonical pathways that are shown to be signiﬁcantly associated with these candidates based on their interactions.30,31 Interestingly, these proteins were in the network of TGF-�1 and interlukin-8 (Figure 5), which are known to play important roles in the molecular mechanism of radiation-induced lung damage.5–7,32 The net- work illustrated implies that C4BPA and VTN have interac- tions with TGF-�1.33,34 Human TGF-�1 increases production of hydrogen peroxide,35 and hydrogen peroxide increases expression of human C4BPA mRNA.36 This network is further supported by our previous ﬁndings that patients with RILT2 also had signiﬁcantly higher plasma TGF-�1 during the course of radiation therapy than those without.32,37 Mul- ticenter studies with a larger number of patients are needed to validate these interesting ﬁndings and to study whether com- bining all these markers together would improve the accuracy of RILT2 prediction. It is interesting that increases in Ig kappa chain V-III region Ti and region HAH are associated with reduced risk of RILT. Ig kappa chain is one type of light chain, which is the small polypeptide subunit of an antibody (or Ig). It takes part in any immune system process that functions in the calibrated response of an organism to a potential internal or invasive "
