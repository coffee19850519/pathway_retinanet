  "Figure_title": "FIGURE 5. Potential network of the newly identified pro- tein markers. The markers, vitronectin (VTN) and C4b-bind- ing protein alpha chain (C4BPA), were put on the ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) server with transforming growth fac- tor beta1 (TGF-�1) to generate this network. A solid line in- dicates an interaction, with the arrowhead indicating direc- tionality. The absence of arrowheads refers to a binding interaction. A dotted line indicates an inferred or indirect interaction. This network suggests mostly indirect associa- tions of these newly identified proteins with the function of TGF-�1, Interlukin-8 (IL-8), and pathways of inflammatory response. "
