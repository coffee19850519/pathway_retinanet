  "Figure_title": "Fig. 1.  Dose Escalation Scheme and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT). Diagram describes the dose  escalation with associated toxicities in each cohort, if any. Sonidegib was administered  orally once daily with etoposide/cisplatin administered every 3 weeks. A study oversight  committee reviewed the data and febrile neutropenia was determined to be secondary to  etoposide/cisplatin and not sonidegib, leading to exclusion of this adverse event from the  DLT definition. The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 800 mg after treating 6  patients. "
