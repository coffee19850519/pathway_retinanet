Best Response to Entrectinib in TKI Treatment-Naïve Extracranial Solid Tumor  Patients Each bar represents maximal tumor regression from baseline based upon the sum of the  longest diameters of target lesions (per RECIST 1.1) in the 24 “Phase 2-eligible” patients  with extracranial solid tumors. The dashed line at −30% indicates the threshold for partial  response. Specific molecular alterations are shown for each patient. The asterisk indicates  one patient with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, who experienced no change in tumor burden  during treatment with entrectinib. "
