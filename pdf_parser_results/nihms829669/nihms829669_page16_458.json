Magnification  10×20. (B) Example of decreasing phospho-EGFR expression after romidepsin initiation (day 3,  pre-erlotinib dosing) and after addition of erlotinib (day 21–28). Magnification 10×20. (C)  Median phospho-EGFR expression levels at baseline (day 1 pre-romidepsin dosing), after  romidepsin initiation (day 3 pre-erlotinib dosing) (N = 13; P = 0.09), and after addition of  erlotinib (day 21–28) (N = 9; P = 0.44).
