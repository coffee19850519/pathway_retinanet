(A) Example  Western Blot demonstrating transient increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation after  initiation of romidepsin. (B) Transient increase in histone H3 acetylation after initiation of  romidepsin and again after addition of erlotinib. (C) Individual patient data showing histone  H3 (N = 9) and H4 (N = 12) acetylation status over time. For normalized H3 acetylation  values, mean increase was 2.10 ± 0.71 in the 8 mg/m2 cohort (P < 0.01) and 2.18 ± 1.09 in  the 10 mg/m2 cohort (P < 0.01). For normalized H4 acetylation values, mean increase was  "
