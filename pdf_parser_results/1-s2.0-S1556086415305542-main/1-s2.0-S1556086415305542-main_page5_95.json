In the enzastaurin phase I study in recurrent glioma patients, one grade 3 QTc prolongation was also reported.33 The PK results of this study indicated no signiÔ¨Åcant PK interaction between enzastaurin and pemetrexed, which was consistent with a previously published phase I study report.32 One possible reason for the absence of any effect on phar- macokinetics was the different pathways used for elimina- tion. Pemetrexed is renally eliminated, whereas a phase I study using [14C] enzastaurin indicated that enzastaurin un- dergoes extensive hepatic metabolism with minimal renal elimination (Eli Lilly and Company, Internal Clinical Study "
