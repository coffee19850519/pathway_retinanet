  "Figure_title": "clinical studies revealed that enzastaurin suppressed thymi- dylate synthase (TS) expression through downregulation of E2F.21 TS expression is one of the known sensitivity markers for pemetrexed, with pemetrexed treatment markedly increas- ing transcription of the TS gene. However, the combination of enzastaurin and pemetrexed signiﬁcantly decrease TS activity and reduced glycogen synthase kinase-3beta/AKT phosphor- ylation and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion.21 Therefore, evidence points to enzastaurin as a promising agent to increase the activity of pemetrexed. In vitro analysis showed that twice daily (BID) dosing could maintain enzastaurin exposures above the targeted plasma concentration longer than QD dosing (data at Eli Lilly on ﬁle), which was conﬁrmed in phase I studies.15,17 We conducted this study to assess safety and tolerability of two dosing regimens of total daily 500 mg enzastaurin (QD or BID) in combination of pemetrexed. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of the combination of enzastaurin and pemetrexed in Japanese ad- vanced NSCLC patients with prior systemic chemotherapy. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the toxicities of this combination and determine the pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin with or without pemetrexed. Antitumor activity of this combi- nation was also assessed. We started with enzastaurin 500 mg QD in combination with pemetrexed to conﬁrm safety in the QD cohorts. After this, we proceeded to 250 mg BID. "
