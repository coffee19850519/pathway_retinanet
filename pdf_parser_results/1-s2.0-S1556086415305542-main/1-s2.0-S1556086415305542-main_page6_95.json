  "Figure_title": "In conclusion, combination therapy for enzastaurin ad- ministered QD or BID with pemetrexed was well tolerated and clinically active in patients with previously treated ad- vanced NSCLC. Both dosing regimens of enzastaurin did not affect pemetrexed pharmacokinetics, and enzastaurin expo- sures remained above the targeted plasma concentration in the presence of pemetrexed. Enzastaurin exposures were higher with the BID regimen, with slightly more grade 3/4 hematological toxicities. These were manageable and BID dosing did not indicate any major tolerability issues. "
