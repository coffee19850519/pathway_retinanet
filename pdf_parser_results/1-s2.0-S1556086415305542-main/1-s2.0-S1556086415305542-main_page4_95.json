  "Figure_title": "steady-state by day 8 of cycle 1, with mean steady-state concentrations (CV %) of 2850 nmol/L (53.5%) and 3420 nmol/L (39.5%) after QD and BID dosing, respectively (Fig- ure 3). Total analyte exposure in cycle 1 was relatively higher than that in cycle 2, suggesting that the loading dose regimen of enzastaurin was instrumental in achieving a steady-state level of total analytes on day 2. PK parameters of pemetrexed for QD and BID dosing are summarized in Table 4. Pemetrexed declined in a tripha- sic manner with an elimination half-life of 3.22 hours, which was consistent with previous observations of pemetrexed single dosing.24 Interpatient variability in CL and Vss was less than 40%, implying constant systemic exposure to pem- etrexed. Pemetrexed pharmacokinetics were not altered by enzastaurin dosing regimen, either QD or BID. "
