  "Figure_title": "FIGURE 1. Study design and phar- macokinetic plan. An oral daily dose of 500 mg enzastaurin was given once daily (QD) in cohort 1 or twice daily (BID) in cohort 2 in combination with 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed on day 1 in repeated 21-day cycles. Cycle 1 started with a 7-day enzastaurin lead-in treat- ment that preceded pemetrexed ad- ministration: a loading dose of 1125 mg enzastaurin on day 1 followed by 500 mg total daily dose on days 2â€“7. Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling is indi- cated by chevrons. All patients received standard daily folate and vitamin B12 supplementation per standard treatment guidelines for pemetrexed infusion. "
