  "Figure_title": "Each cohort was initially designed to enroll six patients. If three or more patients in each cohort experienced dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) during cycle 1, the recruitment was to be ended. A DLT was deﬁned as any of the following drug-related adverse events during cycle 1: (1) hematological toxicity, as determined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0: grade 4 neutropenia that persisted for 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or grade 3 thrombocytopenia with hem- orrhage or requiring a blood transfusion; (2) grade 3/4 non- hematologic toxicities except for the following manageable events: nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, constipa- tion, diarrhea, transient aspartate aminotransferase or alanine transaminase elevation, and transient electrolyte abnormality; (3) grade 3 corrected QT (QTc) prolongation �500 millisec- onds or an increase �60 milliseconds over baseline QT measured at entry.
