  "Figure_title": "conﬁrmed because of disease progression. During the ﬁrst four cycles, two patients discontinued the study because of drug-related toxicities: grade 3 QTc prolongation (QD) and grade 1 increased serum creatinine (BID). Four dosing delays of pemetrexed occurred in three patients (one in QD and two in BID) because of adverse events: neutropenia, thrombocy- topenia, anemia, increased alanine transaminase, hyponatre- mia, and increased blood creatinine. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities were slightly increased in BID dosing compared with QD dosing. One DLT was reported: grade 3 QTc prolongation was observed 1 day after the enzastaurin loading dose in the QD cohort. This male patient with a history of coronary spastic angina experienced asymptomatic QTc prolongation �60 milliseconds over baseline (baseline: 430 milliseconds, post dose: 510 milliseconds). Enzastaurin was halted and his QTc normalized (420 milliseconds) in 6 days without the need of any medication. The patient was withdrawn from the study because of the event. There were no treatment-related deaths. "
