Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody against the EGFR receptor with antitumor activity in NSCLC. This study evaluated the efﬁcacy of cetuximab monotherapy after prior treatment with an oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Methods: Eligible patients had stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent NSCLC with progression on the oral EGFR TKIs geﬁtinib or erlotinib. Cetuximab was administered intravenously at 400 mg/m2 on day 1 and then 250 mg/m2 weekly until disease progression or unaccept- able toxicity. The primary end point was response rate. Results: Eighteen patients were enrolled. Patients were heavily pretreated with chemotherapy and TKIs (average number of treat- ments � 4.2). The response rate was 0/18 (0%), and 28% of patients had conﬁrmed stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% conﬁdence interval, 1.6–5.4 months), and median overall survival was 7.5 months (95% conﬁdence interval, 2.2–19 months). Three patients harbored activating EGFR mutations, and one of them had stable disease for nearly 6 months on cetuximab. Common toxicities were mild and included fatigue, skin rash, and nausea/vomiting. Two patients developed interstitial lung disease, life threatening in one case. Conclusions: Cetuximab monotherapy administered after prior EGFR TKI treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC does not yield clinical responses. "

          "paragraph5": "A berrant activation of the epidermal growth factor re- ceptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase occurs in a number of epithelial malignancies, including non-small cell lung can- cer (NSCLC).1 The signal network downstream of EGFR plays an important role in multiple tumorigenic processes, including cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, protection from apoptosis, and metastasis. Two classes of EGFR-directed targeted therapies have demonstrated efﬁcacy in patients with NSCLC. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds with high afﬁnity to EGFR, inducing tumor cell death by mechanisms including growth arrest, apoptosis, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cy- totoxicity. Cetuximab has modest single-agent activity in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC, with a response rate of 4.5%, stable disease (SD) rate of 30%, and time to progression of 2.3 months.2 In the ﬁrst-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC, the addition of cetuximab to platinum- containing doublets improves overall survival (OS) by ap- proximately 1 month.3,4 The second class of EGFR therapeutics includes the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) geﬁtinib and erlotinib, which extend survival by a median of 2 months in unselected, previously treated patients with NSCLC.5,6 Tumors contain- ing gain-of-function mutations in the EGFR gene are partic- ularly sensitive to TKI therapy, and ﬁrst-line EGFR TKI monotherapy is a viable alternative to chemotherapy in pa- tients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations.7 Preclinical observations had suggested that NSCLC cell lines have differential responses to EGFR TKI therapy and cetuximab,8 and transgenic mice with inducible EGFR- mutant NSCLC responded to prolonged cetuximab treat- ment.9 This study was designed to determine whether cetux- imab monotherapy has activity in patients previously treated with an EGFR TKI and whether patients with EGFR muta- tions have a higher likelihood of response. Response was chosen for the primary end point to simplify a two-stage design, although progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were prespeciﬁed secondary end points. "

Patients with asymptomatic, stable brain metastases were eligible. Patients received intravenous cetuximab, 400 mg/m2, followed by weekly infusions of 250 mg/m2. Four weekly treatments constituted one cycle, and CT scans were per- formed every two cycles to document response. A designa- tion of partial response or SD required conﬁrmation as deﬁned by RECIST. All radiographs were centrally reviewed at Massachusetts General Hospital. All patients were required to have an available tissue sample for EGFR mutation testing, which was performed centrally at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amend- ments-certiﬁed laboratory and involved extraction of genomic material from parafﬁn-embedded tissue, followed by polymerase chain reaction ampliﬁcation and direct se- quencing of exons 19 and 21 as previously described.10 The trial used a Simon two-stage design, which en- rolled 18 patients in the ﬁrst stage of accrual. The trial was to proceed to enroll 28 evaluable patients if 1 or more response was observed in the ﬁrst group. This design provided a 57% chance of early termination if the true response rate was �3%. PFS (survival without disease progression or death) and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The clinical trial protocol was approved and moni- tored by the local institutional review board at all sites, and all patients provided written informed consent. Data were compiled and analyzed centrally at Massachusetts General Hospital. "

Patients were primarily women with heavily pretreated (av- erage number of prior treatments � 4.2) adenocarcinoma (Table 1). Of three patients with tumors harboring EGFR mutations, all previously responded to TKI therapy (range, 6–21 months). The remaining patients had SD or progressive disease on prior TKI therapy, with a median treatment dura- tion of 7 months. After treatment with cetuximab, none of the patients met the criteria for a clinical response, but ﬁve patients (28%) had conﬁrmed SD (median, 5.4 months). The re- mainder of the patients either had progressive disease or unconﬁrmed SD. At the time of analysis, the median potential fol- low-up was 20 months and minimum follow-up was 12 months. No patients remain on treatment, but ﬁve patients were still alive. The median PFS is 1.8 months (95% conﬁdence interval, 1.6–5.4 months) (Figure 1A), and the median OS is 7.5 months (95% conﬁdence interval, 2.2–19 months) (Figure 1B).

In addition, a published report described a patient with an exon 19 deletion mutation who responded to cetuximab before geﬁtinib or erlo- tinib therapy.11 Among our three patients with EGFR mutations, we saw no responses. One patient with an exon 19 deletion and prior complete response to erlotinib lasting 10 months achieved SD on cetuximab for 6 months, which was one of the longest periods of beneﬁt from treatment in our study. Furthermore, repeat biopsy of this patient’s tumor after TKI therapy had demonstrated an acquired T790M resistance mutation. In pre- clinical work, mice harboring xenograft tumors containing an exon 19 deletion and T790M had dramatic tumor responses when treated with the combination of cetuximab and the irre- versible EGFR TKI, BIBW2992.12 Although concurrent EGFR blockade with cetuximab and a TKI may be challenging because of overlapping toxicities, clinical trials using such combinations and modeled after the preclinical models are underway in pa- tients with acquired TKI resistance.13,14 Although cetuximab seems to be a modestly effective drug in combination with chemotherapy for ﬁrst-line treat- ment of NSCLC, the search for predictive biomarkers has been disappointing. Biomarkers that have been tested include increased EGFR gene copy number, EGFR protein expres- sion by immunohistochemistry, and KRAS mutations, but none have been validated in NSCLC.3,4,15 Hopefully, future investigations will be able to identify an effective biomarker to help select patients most likely to respond to cetuximab and other anti-EGFR antibodies.
