Detection of methylation proﬁles of genes in NSCLC could provide insight into differential pathways to malignancy and lead to strategies for better treatment of individuals with NSCLC. Methods: We determined the DNA methylation status of 27 genes using quantitative MethyLight assays in lung tumor samples from 117 clinically well-characterized NSCLC patients. Results: Hypermethylation was detected in one of more of the genes in 106 (91%) of 117 cases and was detected at high levels (percentage methylation reference (PMR) ≥ 4%) in 79% of NSCLC cases. Methyla- tion of APC, CCND2, KCNH5 and, RUNX was signiﬁcantly more frequent in adenocarcinomas compared to squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), while methylation of CDKN2A was more common in SCC. Hypermethy- lation of KCNH5, KCNH8, and RARB was more frequent in females compared to males. Hypermethylation of APC and CCND2 was inversely associated with proliferation score assessed by Ki-67 level. Conclusions: Our ﬁndings of differential gene hypermethylation frequencies in tumor tissues from patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell cancers and in females compared to males suggests that further investigation is warranted in order to more fully understand the potential disparate pathways and/or risk factors for NSCLC associated with histologic type and gender. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of these new cases and includes the following his- tologic types: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma and mixed histologies. Approximately 25–33% of NSCLC patients present with stage I or II disease, which permits surgical resection with curative intent. However, despite a complete and presumably curative resection, approximately 40–50% of patients with resected NSCLC die of recurrent disease [3]. "

          "paragraph12": "In recent years, much attention has focused on whether women and men differ with respect to the epidemiologic and clinicopatho- logic features of NSCLC. Recent trends in the United States show that while incidence in men has declined during the past decades, lung cancer has continued to increase in women [4]. Further, much of the current evidence suggests that women have an increased suscepti- bility to lung cancer, are younger at age of diagnosis, are more likely to have adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinomas, and have better response to therapy and improved survival [5–9]. Identifying the molecular proﬁles of these patients could provide insight into differential pathways to malignancy in females com- pared to males and could lead to strategies for better treatment of individuals with NSCLC. It has recently become clear that epigenetic alterations play an important role in cancer development and result in changes in gene function that occur without changes in nucleotide sequence [10]. One of the most well studied epigenetic changes is DNA methylation, which adds a methyl group to cytosines preceding guanidines (also called CpG dinucleotides). Methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the gene leads to gene silencing "

A number of genes appear to be aberrantly methylated in tumor as opposed to non-tumor tissues from NSCLC patients [13–19]. Multiple studies have attempted to assess the clinical signiﬁcance of one gene, or a small set of genes, in differentiating the clinicopathological features of these tumors [16,18,20–25]. However, most of these studies utilized qualitative methylation-speciﬁc PCR (MSP) in order to detect DNA methyla- tion, a method that can sometimes lead to false positive results and does not distinguish between low and high level methylation [26]. Furthermore, results in these studies have been inconsistent due to varying methylation detection protocols, PCR primers, and study populations, and none have comprehensively studied more than 10 genes. In the present study, we chose to quantify methylation of genes which were potentially important in lung cancer, many of which have been assessed by others but some which have not been previ- ously evaluated (Appendix 1). The selected genes affect apoptosis (DAPK1, RUNX3, TMS1, PTEN, and SOCS3), cell adhesion, inva- sion and/or metastasis (OPCML, CDH13, BVES, APC, CDH1, IGSF4, KCNH5, and PCSK6), cell cycle control (CCND2, RASSF1, APC, FHIT, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, P14, and PTEN), cell proliferation and/or dif- ferentiation (RARB, IGFBP3, KCNH5, KCNH8, SOCS3 and PTGS2), and DNA-repair and/or detoxiﬁcation of DNA adducts (FHIT, MLH1, MGMT, FANCF, and GSTP1). In order to assess more broadly the clinical signiﬁcance of gene hypermethylation in NSCLC, we determined the DNA methylation status of these 27 genes using quantitative MethyLight assays in lung tumor samples from 117 clinically well-characterized NSCLC patients.

Ampliﬁcation of bisulﬁte-converted �-actin (ACTB) was used to normalize for input DNA. Samples that were negative for ACTB were excluded in the methylation analysis. A plasmid containing bisulﬁte-converted ACTB gene of known concentration was diluted and used as the standard curve for quantiﬁcation. The assay for a given set of samples was considered valid only if the converted U-DNA was not ampliﬁed, while the converted M-DNA was ampli- ﬁed. The percentage methylated reference (PMR) for each locus was calculated by dividing the GENE: reference ratio of a sample by the GENE: reference ratio of M-DNA and multiplying by 100 [31]. Twenty-seven genes, plus the control gene ACTB, were analyzed in this study. "

However, for assessing associations of hypermethylation with behavioral and clinical data, we used a cutoff value of PMR > 4% which has been val- idated in the literature as a standard cutoff and is associated with loss of protein expression [31–34]. When multiple cancerous tissue samples were available, we randomly chose one of the cancerous blocks to be used in this analysis. Factors associated with patient and tumor characteristics were assessed univariately with chi- square tests for trend and logistic regression. In the ﬁnal analysis, multivariable adjustments were made to adjust for the potentially confounding effects of histologic type, gender, and tumor size. Exact logistic regression was utilized to compute risk estimates and conﬁ- dence intervals when the prevalence of gene methylation was low. In the multivariable analyses, p-values and 95% conﬁdence intervals were adjusted to take into account multiple comparisons by setting the false discovery rate (FDR) equal to 0.05, using PROC MULTTEST [35] and subsequently recalculating conﬁdence intervals [36]. A two-sided 0.05 test level determined statistical signiﬁcance for all analyses. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). "

However, in squamous cell carcinomas, methylation of CDKN2A (46% vs. 14%) and MGMT (10% vs. 0%) was more common than in non-BAC adenocarcinomas. The methylation patterns in large cell carcinomas (n = 19) and BACs (n = 8) were similar to those of non-BAC adenocarcinomas. In univariate analyses, female gender was associated with increased methylation frequency among the 117 NSCLC cases, as RARB, OPCML, KCNH5, and KCNH8 had signiﬁcantly higher frequencies of methylation among females compared to males (p < 0.05, data not shown). However, as 46% of adenocarcinomas but only 26% of squamous cell carcinomas were in female subjects, the relationships between gender and gene methylation are likely confounded by histologic type. In order to assess the independent associations between gender and methylation after taking histol- ogy into account, we analyzed methylation frequencies stratiﬁed by gender and histology (Table 4). Interestingly, among those with adenocarcinoma, hypermethylation of two (KCNH8 and RARB) of the four genes more frequently hypermethylated overall was sig- niﬁcantly more frequent in females compared to males. Conversely, among those with squamous cell carcinoma, hypermethylation of APC, BVES, and CDKN2A were somewhat more frequent in males compared to females, although none of those comparisons were statistically signiﬁcant. Finally, in the small number (n = 20) of subjects with large cell NSCLC, hypermethylation at PMR ≥ 4% of KCNH5, KCNH8, OPCML, and RUNX was common (>50%) in females (n = 7) but rare (<20%) in males (n = 13).

In terms of tumor differentiation, APC was more commonly detected in well (56%) or moderately (49%) differentiated tumors compared to poorly differentiated tumors (30%, p = 0.04 test for trend). Sim- ilar patterns were present for CCND2 and RASSF1, although these trends did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. Hypermethylation at PMR ≥ 4% of APC (p = 0.05), CCND2 (p = 0.009), and to a lesser degree RUNX (p = 0.08) was somewhat inversely associated with proliferation score assessed by Ki-67 level (Fig. 1). Conversely, hypermethylation of RARB (p = 0.06) is asso- ciated with increased proliferation score. Speciﬁcally, CCND2 was methylated in 49% of tumors with low Ki-67 (<30%), 23% of tumors with medium Ki-67 (30–70%), and 20% of tumors with high Ki-67 (>70%). Similarly, APC was methylated more frequently in those with low (51%) compared to medium (33%) or high (29%) Ki-67 levels. In order to assess the independent associations between gene hypermethylation and histologic type, tumor size, and gender, we conducted multiple multivariable logistic regressions (Table 6). Since the BAC (n = 8) adenocarcinomas showed similar methylation patterns as the non-BAC adenocarcinomas, these two histologic groups were combined for these analyses. In multivariable anal- yses adjusting for the potential false discovery rate associated with multiple comparisons (15 different models), methylation of a num- ber of genes remained associated with histologic type. Methylation at PMR ≥ 4% of APC (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.0–0.6), CCND2 (OR = 0.0, 95% CI 0.0–0.4), KCNH5 (OR = 0.1, 95% CI 0.0–0.5) and RUNX (OR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.0–0.6) was signiﬁcantly less likely in squamous cell carci- nomas compared to adenocarcinomas.

Our ﬁndings of substantial differences in gene methylation pat- terns depending on histologic typing of NSCLCs have been reported to some degree in the literature. Similar to what we observed in the present study, a number of others [13,16,17,21,37] have noted that APC is more frequently methylated in adenocarcinomas com- pared to squamous cell carcinomas, although this has not always been noted [38]. Similarly, methylation of RUNX was detected with higher frequency in adenocarcinomas compared to squamous cell carcinomas in previous studies [16,39,40]. Conversely, methylation of CDKN2A (also known as p16INK4a) has previously been reported to be more common in squamous cell carcinomas compared to ade- nocarcinomas in most [13,16,18,20,24,40] but not all [21,37] prior studies. However, we believe that our ﬁndings that methylation of CCND2 is frequent in adenocarcinomas (46%) but not squamous cell carcinomas (3%) and that methylation of KCNH5 and KCNH8 is less frequent in adenocarcinomas (26% and 12%, respectively) but is speciﬁc to this class of tumors, are new to the literature. Aber- rant methylation of cyclin D2 (CCND2) has been previously noted as potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of NSCLC [41]. How- ever, in that report, potential differences in methylation of CCND2 between squamous and adenocaricomas in NSCLC tumors were not evaluated. Methylation of APC and CCND2, while common in cancer tissues, is also detected frequently in matched non-cancerous lung tissue [19], suggesting that methylation of these two genes may not be a cancer-speciﬁc change, but may be the result of environmental exposure, perhaps due to smoking. We noted a number of important differences in hypermethyla- tion frequency in females compared to males, even after taking into account histologic type. Females with adenocarcinoma were sig- niﬁcantly more likely to have methylated CDH13, KCNH5, KCNH8, and RARB compared to males. Interestingly, these differences were not observed in squamous cell carcinomas, although KCNH5 and KCNH8 were not hypermethylated in any squamous cell cancers, regardless of gender. Conversely, males with squamous cell carci- nomas were more likely to have hypermethylation of APC, BVES, and CDKN2A (p16INK4a). These substantial differences have not been consistently noted in the literature [16,18,20–22,42], per- haps because few studies have stratiﬁed by histologic type when assessing hypermethylation differences by gender. Since females are more likely to have adenocarcinomas compared to males [43], in other studies, differences in hypermethylation frequency due "

These substantial differences in hypermethylation by gender suggest the possibility of differential pathways and/or risk factors for NSCLC between genders. Hypermethylation of RARB was similarly common (31%) in males and females with squamous cell carcinoma, but was substantially more common in females with adenocarcinama (54%) or large cell carcinoma (57%) compared to males (11% and 23%, respectively). Gender differences have historically been noted and debated in the literature with respect to susceptibility and risk factors for NSCLC, especially with regards to the effect of cigarette smoking as well as survival and effectiveness of treatment. The relevance of these variations remains unclear [6–9,44–47]. Epidemiologic stud- ies have generally noted that women with NSCLC are more likely to have developed adenocarcinoma, tend to be younger than men, and are more likely never to have smoked [4,5,48,49]. Additionally, for a given stage and treatment regimen, women may have bet- ter outcomes than men [7,45]. Hormonal factors may account for differences between men and women with regards to lung can- cer [50,51] although how hormones relate to gene methylation patterns in NSCLC remains unclear. In one study, estrogen recep- tor (ER) alpha promoter methylation was increased in males with NSCLC compared to females and was associated with poorer prog- nosis [52]. Another proposed explanation is that there is decreased DNA-repair capacity in women compared to men [53], although we did not ﬁnd evidence that methylation of DNA-repair associ- ated genes was differential in males compared to females in the ﬁve DNA-repair genes we studied (FHIT, MLH1, MGMT, FANCF, and GSTP1). To our knowledge, hypermethylation of KCNH5 and KCNH8, two voltage-gated, ether a go-go (Eag 1) family potassium channels, has not been previously studied with regards to human cancers, although KCNH2 has been reported to be downregulated in breast cancer [54]. The role of potassium channels in cancer has gained increasing interest in recent years as a possible target for tumor therapy [55,56]. In the present study, hypermethylation of KCNH8 was observed in tumors from six (25%) of 24 females with adenocar- cinoma, but was not observed in any males with adenocarcinoma (n = 27) or tumors from squamous cell carcinomas from either gen- der (n = 39). Interestingly, hypermethylation of KCNH8 was present in 5 (71%) of 7 female cases but only 1 (8%) of 13 male cases of large cell carcinoma. With regards to hypermethylation of KCNH5, we observed similar but less dramatic differences. Importantly, we previously reported that hypermethylation of KCNH5 and KCNH8 "

Our study, and its comparison to other’s work, has a number of important limitations. Detection of methylation of the various genes is dependent on the primers and probes used to indicate speciﬁc sequence regions, and differences in gene-speciﬁc detec- tion rates and as well as associations with clinical features of the tumors may be due to variation in the methodologies used across studies. In the current study, we used quantitative Methy- Light, with a cutoff of 4% PMR, to determine associations with methylation. This method is considered sensitive and speciﬁc for gene-speciﬁc methylation [30,57]. Study ﬁndings were similar when a cutoff of 0% PMR was utilized. However, a number of meth- ods, some quantitative and others less sensitive and/or speciﬁc qualitative procedures, have been utilized in previous reports, so direct comparisons in study ﬁndings across studies may not be entirely possible. In the literature, methylation of FHIT, GSTP1, and MGMT frequently occurs in NSCLC [21,24,37,42,58] but in the cur- rent study, methylation of these genes was rarely detected. The gene-speciﬁc discrepancies we observed are likely due to a num- ber of factors, such as assay-speciﬁc differences including target sites of CpG island loci, primers or probes, assay conditions includ- ing annealing temperatures and the conditions of sodium bisulfaite conversion, differences in tumor characteristics such as type of sample, tumor histology, and level of tumor heterogeneity, and ﬁnally, differences in patient populations with regards to age and gender. Primary tumor blocks were unavailable for many of the subjects in the original imaging study, potentially limiting the gen- eralizability of our ﬁndings, and sample sizes within histologic subtypes and gender were limited. Further, we were unable to assess the effect of smoking status on methylation in those with NSCLC, as only ﬁve subjects (4%) were never-smokers. Our ﬁnd- ings may not be generalizable to populations in which a larger proportion of NSCLC is attributed to cigarette smoking. The dis- tribution of histologic types in the current study was somewhat dissimilar to cases of NSCLC in the United States in general, as squamous and large cell carcinomas were somewhat overrepre- sented [43]. However, the large proportion of non-adenocarcinoma cases and relative heterogeneity of our study tissue samples with respect to histologic subtypes allowed us to identify important differences between adenocarcinomas and squamous cell NSCLCs, comparisons which have rarely been assessed in other studies due to the homogenous nature of their tumor samples. Finally, it is unclear how strongly methylation status is correlated with expression status for the examined genes. Gene expression anal- yses were not conducted in the current study. However, prior studies using MethyLight have shown that promoter methylation (PMR > 4%) of CDKNsA, MLH1, and MGMT was strongly associated with respective loss of protein expression assessed by immuno- histochemistry in colorectal cancers [32]. In a more recent study in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, there was good correlation between the presence of MGMT protein expression and unmethylated sta- tus using MethyLight [34] and MethyLight performed better than qualitative methylation-speciﬁc PCR (MSP). However, in another study, methylation of DAPK (using MSP) was not related with gene silencing in lung cancer cell lines and a number of CpG dinucleotides were often methylated in expression-negative tis- sues [59]. Clearly there may be mechanisms other than promoter hypermethylation contributing to down-regulation of gene expres- sion. In summary, in the present study of 117 patients with NSCLC, we found that methylation of a number of genes was strongly asso- ciated with histologic type; adenocarcinoma was associated with increased methylation of APC, CCND2, and RUNX, squamous cell carcinoma was associated with increased methylation of CDKN2A "

Conversely, males with squamous cell carcinomas were more likely to have hyperme- thylation of APC, BVES, and CDKN2A (p16INK4a). The dissimilar pattern of gene hypermethylation in adeno- carcinomas compared to other forms of NSCLC implies different pathogenesis of cancer by histologic type. Further, our ﬁndings of differential gene hypermethylation frequencies among those with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell cancers in females compared to males suggests that further investigation is warranted in order to more fully understand the potential disparate pathways and risk factors, especially with regard to smoking and hormones, as well as potential differential treatment modalities for NSCLC associated with histology and gender.
