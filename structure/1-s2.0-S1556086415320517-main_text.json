The SRC inhibitor dasatinib demonstrates antitumor activity in geﬁtinib- resistant cells lines and xenografts. Dasatinib is tolerable for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and in com- bination with erlotinib. Methods: We conducted this phase II study of dasatinib 70 mg twice daily in patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma and acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. After a protocol amendment based on evolving data about both drugs, patients received dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg daily with continued erlotinib after developing acquired resistance. Enrolled patients either harbored an activating mutation in EGFR or experienced clinical beneﬁt with single-agent erlotinib or geﬁtinib, followed by RECIST documented progression while being treated with an EGFR-TKI. Results: Twenty-one patients were enrolled, 9 under the original trial design and 12 after the protocol amendments. We observed no complete or partial responses (0% observed rate, 95% conﬁdence interval: 0–18%). The median time to progression was 0.5 months (range, 0.2–1.8 months) in patients treated with dasatinib and 0.9 months (range, 0.4–5 months) for patients treated with dasatinib and erlotinib in combination. Pleural effusions and dyspnea were fre- quent toxicities. Conclusions: Dasatinib has no activity in patients with EGFR- mutant lung adenocarcinoma with acquired resistance to erlotinib and geﬁtinib.

          "paragraph5": "S eventy percent of patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor recep- tor (EGFR) gene experience a partial response when treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib or geﬁtinib.1 However, the majority of patients progress within 17 months of the start of the treatment.2 At least 50% of lung cancer patients with acquired resistance to erlotinib or ge- ﬁtinib develop a secondary T790M mutation within EGFR, and another 10 to 15% of patients demonstrate MET ampli- ﬁcation.3–5 Therapies directed against these mechanisms of acquired resistance are desperately needed. SRC is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that demonstrates increased protein levels in EGFR-dependent tumors. SRC and EGFR are proteins capable of mutual phosphorylation that share downstream effectors such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PTEN/Akt and STAT proteins.6 Because of these func- tional associations, SRC kinase has been proposed as a target to overcome acquired resistance in EGFR-mutant tumors. Preclinical models demonstrate EGFR-mutant cell lines containing either L858R (H3255) or exon 19 deletions (PC9 or HCC827) undergo apoptosis when treated with the SRC inhibitor dasatinib.7 Geﬁtinib-resistant adenocarcinoma cells with T790M (PC9/ZD) or MET ampliﬁcation (HCC827 GR5) undergo cell death when treated with dasatinib.8 Dasatinib also inhibits tumor growth in HCC827 GR5 nude mouse xenografts.8 Dasatinib has been studied in patients with advanced solid tumors, with pleural effusions dose-limiting.9 Dasatinib can be combined with erlotinib in unselected pa- tients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).10 Given its preclinical rationale and early clinical trial results, we conducted a phase II study of dasatinib in patients with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma and acquired resis- tance to the EGFR-TKIs erlotinib and geﬁtinib.

Given these observations, we now recommend con- tinued erlotinib in patients with acquired resistance while also adding second-line treatment agents and amended this protocol to allow patients to continue erlotinib in addition to beginning dasatinib. In addition, new data indicated that dasatinib 100 mg daily provided similar efﬁcacy with less pleural effusions when used to treat patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),13 and we further amended this trial to allow a dose of dasatinib 100 mg daily.

{
               "paragraph1": "In this phase II trial of SRC inhibitor dasatinib, with and without erlotinib, in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and acquired resistance to erlotinib, no objective responses were observed. Pleural effusions and dyspnea were the most fre- quent and signiﬁcant toxicities. Regardless of whether erlo- tinib was continued, patients were treated with dasatinib for a median of less than 1 month due to a combination of disease progression and toxicity. Haura et al.10 studied dasatinib and erlotinib in unse- lected patients with advanced lung cancer previously un- treated. Two partial responses were reported, one in a patient whose tumor harbored an EGFR exon 19 deletion. This response likely reﬂects solely the effect of erlotinib in a tumor with a sensitizing EGFR mutation. Very recently, Johnson et al. also reported the results of a phase II trial of single-agent dasatinib as ﬁrst-line treatment for unselected patients with advanced NSCLC. Neither SRC activity nor mutations in EGFR (or KRAS) were associated with the modest response rates reported—overall disease control rate of 43% and progression-free survival of 1.36 months.15 Pleural effusions were observed in 66% of patients enrolled in this study. The pleural effusions observed were clinically more signiﬁcant for the patients who received dasatinib 70 mg twice daily—50% of whom required thora- centesis or tube thoracostomy.

               "paragraph2": "dasatinib 100 mg daily and erlotinib required a tube thora- costomy. Prior studies in patients with CML and advanced solid tumors treated with dasatinib also observed pleural effusions to be dose-related.9,13 Johnson et al.15 reported that the presence of pleural effusions in patients with advanced NSCLC before treatment with dasatinib predicted the devel- opment of clinically signiﬁcant effusions during treatment. In many cases, it was difﬁcult to discern whether these new pleural effusions were dasatinib-related drug toxicity or evidence of progressive cancer. Unlike patients with CML or solid tumors other than lung cancer treated with dasatinib, in whom pleural effusions can easily be recognized as drug toxicity and managed with dose attenuation, diuretics, and corticosteroids without treatment delays, this complication proved very challenging to manage in our patients with lung adenocarcinoma. The amended trial design also limited interpretation of the study’s negative results. We simultaneously changed the dasatinib dosing schedule and added erlotinib to the treatment regimen to incorporate the latest information about both drugs. By making changes to two aspects of the trial design at once, we clouded our ability to discern the true reason (or reasons) for the disappointing results. We found the combination of dasatinib and erlotinib to be inactive, with signiﬁcant toxicities. Our study suggests that SRC inhibitors merit no further study in patients with EGFR- driven lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, these patients remain ideal candidates for clinical trials investigating new strategies to overcome acquired resistance. "
