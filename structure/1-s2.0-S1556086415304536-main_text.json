     "paragraph4": "Introduction: Erlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has improved survival and quality of life in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after ﬁrst- or second-line chemotherapy. Asian origin, adenocarcinoma histology, female gender, lack of tobacco use, and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor are signif- icant independent predictors of response to Erlotinib. Although tobacco use is considered a major cause of NSCLC, other risk factors such as wood-smoke exposure (WSE) are associated. Almost 3 billion people worldwide rely on solid fuels as their primary source of domestic energy for cooking and heating. Methods: In this study, 150 consecutive unselected patients with histologically proven NSCLC with progression after prior ﬁrst- or second-line chemotherapy and/or poor performance status were treated with Erlotinib 150 mg/d. Clinical and pathologic character- istics were associated with response. Results: Overall response to Erlotinib was observed in 51 patients [34%; 95% conﬁdence interval {95% CI}, 29.9–37.6]. In multivar- iate analysis, clinical features associated with response to Erlotinib were adenocarcinoma (35 versus 20%; p � 0.05) and WSE (83 versus 13%; p � 0.001).

Conclusions: WSE is associated with better response to Erlotinib and improved progression-free survival in patients with NSCLC. Additional studies in epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway in WSE-associated NSCLC are warranted. "

In 2007, the estimated incidence in the United States was 213,380 with 160,390 deaths.1 In 2002, 8044 new cases and 8255 deaths were reported in Mexico.2 Although tobacco use is considered a major cause of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), other etiologic factors have been proposed for its development, including radon exposure, cooking fumes, asbestos, heavy metals, human papillomavi- rus infection, and genetic susceptibility. Wood dust is desig- nated as a human carcinogen and a risk factor for lung cancer.3 Wood is burned for heating and cooking or just for pleasure in many homes worldwide. Almost 3 billion people rely on solid fuel (biomass and coal) as their primary source of domestic energy. Most of them live in developing coun- tries but there are also many living in countries with a cold climate, such as those in Northern Europe.4 In addition North Americans, particularly in Canada and the northwestern and northeastern sections of the United States, have increasingly turned to woodburning as an alternative method for domestic heating because of increasing energy costs.4,5 Wood-smoke exposure (WSE) for �50 years has been associated with increased risk of lung cancer as compared with pulmonary tuberculosis, interstitial lung disease, and miscellaneous pulmonary conditions [odds ratio, 1.9; 95% conﬁdence interval {CI}, 1.1–3.5] after adjusting for age, "

Wood byproducts, such as benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are known carcinogens.4 Macrophage dys- function and increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases, speciﬁcally MMP-2 and -9 have been reported. Several stud- ies have demonstrated that WSE could increase phospho-p53 protein. These changes could be similar to those caused by tobacco smoke.7 Chemotherapy, alone or in combination with radiation therapy, is the standard treatment for advanced NSCLC. With current ﬁrst-line platinum-based chemotherapy schemes, me- dian survival is 7 to 10 months.8–10 Docetaxel or Pemetrexed- based regimens are the current standard for second-line che- motherapy in NSCLC, exhibiting a 6 to 9% response rate (RR) and median survival time of 6 to 8 months.11–13 How- ever, improvements in chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC have reached a plateau. Advances in understanding the mo- lecular basis of cancer biology have led to the discovery of several potential molecular targets, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a tyrosine kinase (TK) re- ceptor of the ErbB family that is usually altered in epithelial tumors.14 It mediates cell proliferation, differentiation, sur- vival, angiogenesis, and migration,15 and is overexpressed in 40 to 80% of NSCLC tumors.16,17 Erlotinib is an orally active, quinazoline TK inhibitor that speciﬁcally targets EGFR. The BR.21 phase III study compared Erlotinib versus placebo in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and one or two prior chemotherapy regimens, and provided the ﬁrst evidence that EGFR inhibitors extend survival in chemotherapy-refrac- tory NSCLC; patients receiving Erlotinib displayed signiﬁ- cant longer overall survival (6.7 versus 4.7 months) and progression-free survival (PFS) (2.2 versus 1.8 months) than those receiving placebo, with an overall RR of 8.9%. In addition, a higher RR was observed among speciﬁc subpopu- lations, including women, Asian ethnicity, patients who had never smoked, and patients with adenocarcinoma.12 More- over, expression of EGFR by immunohistochemistry or ﬂu- orescent in situ hybridization is another independent predictor of response and survival.18 We conducted a prospective study to identify prognosis-associated predictive factors in patients treated with Erlotinib in Mexican population.

This rate is higher than the documented by other groups who treated unselected patients with advanced NSCLC with Er- lotinib.12,20,21 In the interim analysis of compassional use of Erlotinib, a total of 5908 patients were included.22 Overall response was reported in 10% of patients with median PFS of 15.1 week, with 12.4 weeks after ﬁrst-line and 12.7 weeks after second line chemotherapy.18 This ﬁnding suggests that the clinical characteristics of our cohort are different when compared with those of previous studies. In our population, the smoking history was reported in 53%, which is lesser to that reported in developed countries. However, epidemiologic studies of NSCLC in Mexico have shown a 66% of smoking- associated lung cancer.23 It is important to mention that patients included in this study were not selected based on their clinical characteristics, but mainly on their assistance to the pulmonary neoplasms clinic of the hospitals previously mentioned. These differences could be associated with a higher overall response.

In addition, in the absence of WSE we found response and PFS rates (12.3% and 5.3 months, respectively) similar to what had been previously reported.12,20,21 It is known that WSE is a risk factor for lung cancer.31 However, few studies consider this factor in sub- group analysis, owing the fact that nearly all studies are performed in developed countries, in which WSE is unusual. However, our cohort included a high percentage of people living in rural areas and we found that 28% of patients had WSE-related NSCLC. In our cohort, the lack of association in the multivariate analysis of clinical-pathologic factors previ- ously described in the literature for response and PFS could be consequence of a strong association between the endpoints and WSE. The ﬁnding that WSE is the most important independent predictor of PFS and response to Erlotinib treat- ment has not been previously reported. The most prominent predictor of somatic mutations in EGFR is lack of cigarette smoking.32,33 When considering all geographic and ethnic groups, EGFR mutations are identiﬁed "

WSE in contrast to cigarette smoking does not induce the activity or expression of cytochromes at pulmonary level in rats.38 So it is unlikely that WSE could affect Erlotinib clearance and explain our results. In relation to central nervous system metastasis, there have been reports about response to Erlotinib treatment when EGFR mutation is present, which suggest that inhibitors of EGF-receptor TK are capable of penetrating the blood–brain barrier in presence of cerebral metastasis. This could explain the absence of poor prognosis related with cerebral metastasis when patients were treated with Erlotinib.39,40 Limited data are available on the etiopathogenesis, molecular abnormalities, and prognosis of WSE-related NSCLC; nevertheless, the association between WSE and better response and PFS suggests that carcinogenic mecha- nisms in NSCLC involve EGFR and/or absent K-Ras muta- tions. Molecular studies in signaling pathways related with EGFR and K-Ras in patients with WSE-associated NSCLC are warranted. In conclusion, patients with WSE-related NSCLC have a high probability of response to Erlotinib with a higher PFS. "
