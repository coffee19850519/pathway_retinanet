Vandetanib was evaluated as a monotherapy in a randomized, double-blind, dose-ﬁnding study in Japan. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy, were randomized to receive once-daily oral vandetanib 100, 200, or 300 mg (1:1:1). The primary objective was to determine the objective response rate for each vandetanib dose. Results: Fifty-three patients received vandetanib (100 mg, n � 17; 200 mg, n � 18; 300 mg, n � 18). The objective response rate in each dose arm was 17.6% (3 of 17; 100 mg), 5.6% (1 of 18; 200 mg), and 16.7% (3 of 18; 300 mg). Common adverse events included rash, diarrhea, hypertension, and asymptomatic QTc pro- longation. The adverse event proﬁle was generally consistent with that reported previously for agents that inhibit the VEGFR or EGFR signaling pathways. Among the three responders evaluated for EGFR mutation, two had no mutation, and in one case, the EGFR mutation status could not be determined by direct DNA sequencing and ampliﬁcation refractory mutation system assay of EGFR exons "

A major focus of new anticancer research is the targeting of cell-signaling pathways that contribute to tumor growth and progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are key drivers of tumor angiogenesis and cell proliferation, respectively, and both pathways have been validated as clinically relevant targets in NSCLC. The addition of bevacizumab, a human- ized anti-VEGF-A monoclonal antibody, to paclitaxel and carboplatin has demonstrated clinical beneﬁt in patients with NSCLC,2 and the EGFR inhibitors geﬁtinib and erlotinib have demonstrated clinical activity as single agents in NSCLC.3,4 Furthermore, EGFR is known to regulate the production of VEGF and other proangiogenic factors5 and resistance to EGFR inhibition has been associated with increased expression of VEGF in a human tumor xenograft model of NSCLC.6 There- fore, targeting the VEGFR and EGFR pathways may be more effective than inhibiting either pathway alone. This hypoth- esis is supported by the promising results from early clinical evaluation of erlotinib and bevacizumab in combination in patients with recurrent NSCLC.7 Vandetanib (ZACTIMATM) is a once-daily, orally available anticancer drug that inhibits VEGFR- and EGFR- dependent signaling,8 as well as the RET (REarranged during "

Phase I studies in advanced solid tumors conducted in the USA/Australia10 and Japan11 showed that once-daily doses of vandetanib (up to and including 300 mg) were generally well tolerated. In the Japanese study, objective tumor responses were observed in 4 of 9 patients with refractory NSCLC. Subsequent phase II studies in advanced NSCLC demonstrated antitumor activity both as a mono- therapy and in combination with certain chemotherapy.12–14 The positive outcome of these phase II trials led to the ongoing phase III evaluation of vandetanib in previously treated advanced NSCLC. The primary objective of this randomized phase IIa study was to assess the objective response rate (ORR) to vandetanib (100, 200, or 300 mg/d) in Japanese patients with refractory NSCLC. The three doses investigated were se- lected based on the outcome of the Japanese phase I trial.11 "

               "paragraph1": "The primary objective of this phase IIa study was to assess the ORR to three doses of vandetanib (100, 200, and 300 mg/d) in Japanese patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC. These doses of vandetanib were selected based on the outcomes of a Japanese phase I study where it was observed that vandetanib was well tolerated up to a dose of 300 mg and objective tumor responses were observed in 4 of 9 patients with NSCLC at doses of either 200 or 300 mg.11 In this study, objective tumor responses were observed at all three doses of vandetanib. The ORR in the 100, 200, and 300 mg arms was 17.6% (3 of 17 patients), 5.6% (1 of 18 patients), and 16.7% (3 of 18 patients), respectively. The DCR and TTP were similar across the three dose arms. It was noted that 50% (9 of 18) of the patients in the 200 mg arm had failed two previous chemotherapy regimens, compared with 23.5% (4 of 17 patients) and 22.2% (4 of 18 patients) in the 100 and 300 mg arms, respectively. It is possible that these differences contributed to the lower ORR observed in the 200 mg arm, although the number of patients in each dose arm was too small to allow any deﬁnitive conclusions to be made. Vandetanib was well tolerated at 100, 200, and 300 mg dose levels in this study. Overall, AEs were generally mild "

In addition, the AE proﬁle was consistent with that determined during phase I evaluation in patients with advanced solid tumors10,11 and phase II monotherapy data in NSCLC.12 Furthermore, the AE proﬁle was also consistent with that reported previously for agents that inhibit the VEGFR17,18 or EGFR4,19 signaling pathways. In general, no apparent dose dependence was noted in the incidence of the common AEs in this study except for asymptomatic QTc prolongation (24%, 56%, and 44% for the 100, 200, and 300 mg dose arms, respectively), an event that was manageable by dose interruption/reduction. A notable feature of this study, and the phase II pro- gram for vandetanib in NSCLC, is that patients with squa- mous cell histology or stable brain metastases were permitted to enter the trials. Both of these factors have been associated with an increased risk of bleeding, including severe life- threatening hemoptysis in NSCLC patients with squamous histology in a randomized phase II study of bevacizumab with carboplatin and paclitaxel.20 These events have also been reported with other inhibitors of VEGF/VEGFR signal- ing, such as sunitinib and sorafenib.17,18 Importantly, no CNS hemorrhage AEs or hemoptysis attributable to vandetanib were reported in this study. The PK proﬁle in this NSCLC patient population was consistent with that seen previously during Phase I evaluation in Japanese and USA/Australian patients with a range of solid tumors.10,11 In patients with NSCLC, speciﬁc EGFR mutations are associated with increased sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors,21,22 and a better survival outcome with geﬁtinib has been shown to correlate with high EGFR gene copy number.23 In this study, an exploratory analysis of tumor samples for ampliﬁcation of EGFR gene copy number and somatic muta- tions of the EGFR gene revealed no clear relationship between EGFR mutation or gene ampliﬁcation status and clinical out- come in patients receiving vandetanib. The EGFR mutation frequency of 4% (1 of 27 patients) is lower than that previously reported,24,25 and further studies are needed to evaluate EGFR mutation status as a possible predictive marker for vandetanib therapy in advanced NSCLC. In addition to EGFR mutation/ampliﬁcation status, plasma proﬁling of cytokines and angiogenic factors may be a feasible approach for identifying blood-based prognostic and activity markers for therapies in NSCLC. Preliminary analysis of plasma concentrations of the angiogenesis mark- ers VEGF and VEGFR-2 in the present study revealed that patients with PR or SD were more likely to have low baseline levels of VEGF than those with PD. It has been shown previously that low pretreatment levels of circulating VEGF correlated with a good response to geﬁtinib treatment in patients with NSCLC.26 The signiﬁcance of the relationship between these biomarkers and clinical outcome requires fur- ther investigation. In conclusion, vandetanib monotherapy (100–300 mg/d) demonstrated antitumor activity with an acceptable safety and tolerability proﬁle in Japanese patients with ad- vanced NSCLC. Based only on this study, there is no com- "
