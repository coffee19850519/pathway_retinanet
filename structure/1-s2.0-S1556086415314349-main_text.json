Preclinical studies demonstrate signiﬁcant interactions between the EGFR and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathways and that simultaneous inhibition may have beneﬁts over EGFR inhibitors alone. Methods: Eligibility criteria: chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIb (with pleural effusion) or IV NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (PS) 0–1. Patients were treated with geﬁtinib 250 mg po daily plus celecoxib 400 mg po every 12 hours. Cycles consisted of 21-day treatment and continued until unaccept- able toxicity or progression of disease. The primary objective was to evaluate the overall response rate; secondary objectives included estimation of progression free survival, overall survival, and to assess the toxicity of this regimen. Results: From January 2004 to November 2004, 31 patients were enrolled: male/female 13/18; median age 70 years (range, 19–93); 68% had adenocarcinoma; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group PS 0/1 13/18; stage IIIb/IV 2/29. Two patients died of interstitial lung disease due to treatment. There were three additional deaths during treatment that were not considered treatment related. Two additional patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events (elevated liver enzymes). Select grade 3/4 toxicities included: pneumonitis (3%), hepatic (7%), diarrhea (7%), and skin (3%). Response rate was 16% (95% CI, 5–34%), median progression free survival and overall survival were 3.2 (95% CI, 2.7–5.7 months) and 7.0 months (95% CI, 3.7–14.2 months), respectively.

Modest gains in survival time and quality of life have resulted from the use of chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.2–6 A multicentered trial from the United Kingdom randomizing patients to supportive care versus platinum- based chemotherapy demonstrated a small, but statistically signiﬁcant, survival advantage for the use of chemotherapy.6 Unfortunately, a plateau in survival times has been reached as comparable survival results are reported with several differ- ent regimens.7 Furthermore, although survival gains are usu- ally modest with chemotherapy, many patients experience grade 3 or 4 toxicities, the extent of which differs based upon the regimen used. Novel strategies and therapeutics with safer side effect proﬁles are greatly needed for this patient population. Geﬁtinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) intracellular tyrosine kinase. Inhibition of this signal transduction cascade can affect tumor growth, angiogenesis, and survival of lung cancer cell lines. Phase II trials of geﬁtinib in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC reported response rates of 11.8% and18.4%, respec- tively.8,9 Substantially more patients achieved stable disease for at least 3 months, so that the disease control rate was approximately 40 to 50%, comparable to what is achieved with chemotherapy in this setting. At a dose of 250 mg daily, geﬁtinib was generally well tolerated with few instances of grade 3 or 4 toxicity. "

     "paragraph11": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is also believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of some malignancies. Investigators at Indiana University characterized the fre- quency of COX-2 expression by immunoblot analysis in primary lung cancers from frozen tumor tissue and matched normal adjacent tissue.10 COX-2 protein was expressed more frequently and at higher levels in adenocarcinomas and squa- mous cell carcinomas of the lung when compared with the normal adjacent tissue. Preclinical data has shown that COX-2 inhibitors inhibit both in vitro and in vivo growth of human cancer lines, demonstrate antiangiogenic activity, in- creased cellular apoptosis, and decreased cellular prolifera- tion.11–13 Furthermore, signiﬁcant intracellular interactions between the EGFR pathway and COX-2 pathway have been reported in preclinical studies, suggesting that simultaneously inhibiting both targets may provide enhanced beneﬁts.14–17 Therefore, based on the desire to develop more effective and safer regimens for patients with advanced NSCLC, this study was designed to assess the efﬁcacy of geﬁtinib, an EGFR inhibitor, with celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, in chemotherapy- naive patients with stage IIIb or IV NSCLC.

The local institutional review boards approved the protocol before enrollment at each site. All patients were treated with geﬁtinib 250 mg po daily plus celecoxib 400 mg po every 12 hours. The study was stopped after we failed to meet our endpoints from stage I to go on to stage II. Each cycle consisted of a 21-day time period and treatment continued until disease progression or intoler- able toxicities occurred. Physical exams and toxicity evalua- tions were completed at baseline and before each cycle and disease assessment was undertaken at baseline and prior to every other cycle. Toxicities were graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. Day 1 treatment of a new cycle was administered only when the absolute neutrophil count was �1000/L and platelets �100,000/L. Patients who re- quired greater than a 14-day interruption in therapy due to toxicity were taken off study. There were no dose reductions allowed for geﬁtinib. Patients with grade 3 or 4 skin toxicity, diarrhea, stomatitis and/or any other signiﬁcant toxicity thought to be related to geﬁtinib were treated with supportive care and geﬁtinib could be held up to 14 days. Treatment was restarted when the patient recovered to baseline or �grade 2. If patients presented with an acute worsening or new onset of respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, geﬁtinib therapy was interrupted and evaluation for intersti- tial lung disease (ILD) was initiated. If ILD was conﬁrmed, geﬁtinib was permanently discontinued. If a patient devel- oped any grade 3 or 4 toxicity attributable to celecoxib, treatment with celecoxib was interrupted until symptoms resolved to a grade 2 or less toxicity and then celecoxib was resumed at a 50% dose reduction. Gastrointestinal bleeding attributable to celecoxib would have required the patient be taken off study. A maximum 14-day treatment interruption was allowed with only one dose reduction allowed per patient. Of note, a study amendment was made on December 21, 2004, stopping the use of celecoxib after evidence was shown correlating the drug with increased risk of serious cardiovascular events.18 This amendment was made during the interval between the ﬁrst and second stages while the data was being analyzed to see if we would proceed with the second stage. This amendment would have only affected those still on study as no further patients were accrued for the study. "

If the true response rate is 45% or higher, this design was expected to provide better than 80% power to conﬁrm that the true response rate is no less than 30%. For progression-free survival and overall survival, a lower 90% one-sided conﬁ- dence interval was constructed around the observed median (either median time to progression or death). Therapy was to be considered having exceeded the current therapeutic standard at the 90% conﬁdence level if the lower bound of this conﬁdence interval was higher than 4 and 10 months, respectively. Response was assessed using the RECIST criteria, and all responses were conﬁrmed a minimum of 4 weeks after the initial response was recorded. Duration of response is deﬁned among responders from earliest date of response to date of progression or death, with those continuing to respond at last data collection as censored. To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements on imaging could neither have had sufﬁcient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufﬁ- cient criteria to show progressive disease.

Our reported response rate with this combination was similar to the single agent activity of ge- ﬁtinib alone in a similar patient population, and thus we failed to meet our primary goal and did not continue the study onto its second stage.19–23 Furthermore, this regimen seems less active than many combination chemotherapy regimens in a similar patient population.7,24,25 In addition, despite having a performance status of 0 or 1 at study entry, the median survival time of only 7.0 months is substantially lower than historical controls with chemotherapy as ﬁrst line therapy (9–10 months) for this patient population on most recent studies. Although ﬁve patients did achieve a partial response, including some with durable responses, it is unclear what the contribution of celecoxib was for these patients. Other studies have combined EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors with disappointing results. Gadgeel et al. had a response rate of 7% when combining geﬁtnib with celecoxib in patients with platinum refractory NSCLC.26 O’Byrne et al. combined geﬁtinib with rofecoxib in patients with platinum- pretreated relapsed NSCLC resulting in a 7% response rate.27 Another study combining erlotinib with celecoxib in patients with relapsed NSCLC resulted in an 8% response rate.28 Several studies evaluating single agent geﬁtinib in a chemonaive patients have been reported. Niho et al. reported a response rate of 30% and median survival of 13.9 months with geﬁtinib as ﬁrst-line treatment in advanced NSCLC in an Asian population.19 Responders on this trial were generally female patients with adenocarcinoma, similar to observations on other studies, including the current study.10,11 Our data suggests that females who never smoked may be a patient population who would be best treated with an EGFR inhibitor upfront. Whether sequencing of therapy with an EGFR in- hibitor as ﬁrst-line therapy followed by chemotherapy second line would affect overall outcomes compared with the reverse order in this patient population remains unknown. Such a question would be worthy of testing in a randomized trial. Although four randomized trials failed to demonstrate a survival difference when treating patients with chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus an EGFR inhibitor, subset analyses on at least two of these trials suggested that in never smokers a survival advantage may still be realized with combined chemotherapy and EGFR blockade.29–32 This strat- egy is being tested in a randomized study by the CALGB in which patients receive erlotinib alone versus chemotherapy plus erlotinib. In the second-line setting, several studies have com- bined a chemotherapy agent with a COX-2 inhibitor, suggest- ing some subsets may beneﬁt from the addition of a COX-2 inhibitor. For example, although Csiki et al. showed no difference in survival by combining celecoxib with docetaxel compared with docetaxel alone as second line therapy, their data suggested that patients with the greatest proportional decline in urinary PGE-M levels experienced survival pro- longation when compared with those with no change or an increase in PGE-M (14.8 versus 6.3 versus 5 months).33 Nugent et al. report in a phase II study of docetaxel and celecoxib in previously treated patients with NSCLC that the "

The study by Niho et al. reported a 10% rate of ILD in their studied Japanese population.19 Other trials sug- gest much lower rates.9,36 In the current study, 2 of 31 patients (7%) developed ILD, both of whom died. There were only four patients whom experienced grade 3 and 4 toxicity of dyspnea. Continued exploration of treating unselected patient populations with targeted agents such as geﬁtinib or cele- coxib are unlikely to signiﬁcantly improve outcomes. In addition to the potential biomarkers mentioned to determine celecoxib sensitivity, several predictors of geﬁtinib efﬁcacy have been reported. These include the presence of mutation in the EGFR tyronine kinase domain, increased gene copy number of EGFR band on FISH analysis, lack of Kras mutations, and lack of pTEN loss among others.37–39 In conclusion, this study combining geﬁtinib with cele- coxib failed to demonstrate improved outcomes when com- pared with historical controls of chemotherapy in a similar patient population. As such, we do not recommend pursuit of this combination in an unselected patient population. The value of adding celecoxib to geﬁtinib remains in doubt, although worthy of further pursuit if a select patient popula- tion can be identiﬁed. "
