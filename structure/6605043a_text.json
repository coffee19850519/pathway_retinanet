We hypothesised that concomitant blockade of NF-kB and EGFR signalling would overcome EGFR-mediated resistance to single-agent bortezomib and induce apoptosis through two molecular pathways. The aim of this phase I trial was to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for bortezomib plus cetuximab in patients with EGFR-expressing epithelial tumours. The 21-day treatment cycle consisted of bortezomib administered on days 1 and 8 through dose escalation (1.3–2 mg m�2). Cetuximab was delivered at a dose of 250 mg m�2 on days 1, 8 and 15 (400 mg m�2 day 1 cycle 1). A total of 37 patients were enroled and given a total 91 cycles. No grade X3 haematological toxicity was noted. Non-hematological grade X3 toxicities included fatigue (22% of patients), dyspnoea (16%) and infection (11%). The MTD was not reached at the highest tested bortezomib dose (2.0 mg m�2). Efficacy outcomes included disease progression in 21 patients (56.7%) and stable disease (SD) at 6 weeks in 16 patients (43.3%). Five of the six patients with SD at 12 weeks were diagnosed with cancers of the lungs or head and neck. This combination therapy was moderately effective in extensively pretreated patients with non-small cell lung or head and neck cancers and warrants further investigation.

          "paragraph7": "Single-agent targeted therapy has proven effective in blocking the growth and spread of many different tumour types. However, one of the main causes of its limited application in cancer treatment is that most tumours are not dependent on a single molecular pathway and are capable of circumventing single-target inhibition through the development of several mechanisms of resistance. Earlier efforts to slow the emergence of resistance have been achieved with combinations of traditional chemotherapies. Similarly, combinations of targeted agents acting on different molecular pathways involved in cancer pathogenesis may provide not only an additive effect, but may also lead to apoptotic synergy and delay the onset of resistance. Of the vast number of possible combinations of targeted agents, preclinical data suggest that there could be a potential benefit from combining bortezomib and cetuximab (Cascone et al, 2008; Sloss et al, 2008; Wagenblast et al, 2008; Wagenblast et al, 2009). Bortezomib is the first drug in a new class of targeted therapies called proteasome inhibitors. The mechanism of action of bortezomib is not entirely known. Bortezomib inhibits the orderly "

          "paragraph8": "degradation of cellular proteins by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, leading to the inactivation of the anti-apoptotic transcriptional regulator, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) (Rajkumar et al, 2005). Inactivation of NF-kB could be one of the mechanisms by which bortezomib induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in solid tumours (Mitsiades et al, 2006). Other mechanisms in non- hematological malignancies may include induction of apoptosis by Bim and Bik protein upregulation (Li et al, 2008), reduction of bcl-2 levels (Mortenson et al, 2005), induction of NOXA protein (Fribley et al, 2006) or reactive oxygen species generation (Ling et al, 2003). Subtoxic concentrations of bortezomib potently sensitise multiple myeloma cell lines to DNA-damaging chemo- therapeutic agents, including cells resistant to these drugs (Mitsiades et al, 2003). Bortezomib also abolishes cell adhesion- mediated drug resistance. Consistent with these preclinical data, bortezomib has been effective in clinical trials for myeloma (Richardson et al, 2003, 2005; Jagannath et al, 2004) and responses have been documented in solid tumours, including renal cancer (Kondagunta et al, 2004), small cell and non-small cell lung cancer (Lara et al, 2006a, b), and prostate cancer (Hainsworth et al, 2007). Cetuximab is a chimeric mouse–human antibody targeted against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Competitive binding of cetuximab to EGFR prevents ligand-induced tyrosine kinase activation and induces receptor downregulation. In clinical trials, cetuximab is active in colorectal cancer (Rosenberg et al, 2002; Cunningham et al, 2004; Folprecht et al, 2004; Lenz et al, Received 9 February 2009; revised 20 March 2009; accepted 25 March 2009 "

Upregulation of cell-surface EGFR by bortezomib was indicated in earlier studies and recently reported in squamous-cell cancer lines (Lorch et al, 2007). This observation strongly suggests that bortezomib could sensitise cancer cells to EGFR inhibition. However, another preclinical study has reported that the combination of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and bortezomib resulted in nearly complete NF-kB blockade and synergistically inhibited the proliferation of renal cancer cells, but only when TKI exposure occurred first or simultaneously with bortezomib exposure (An and Rettig, 2007). Pretreatment with bortezomib resulted in incomplete NF-kB blockade and had an antagonistic effect on proliferation. Thus, the activity of combination therapy could be schedule-dependent, and concomitant administration of both drugs could be the most optimal schedule, with the important caveat that schedule-dependent effects could vary by tumour type given the broad range of signalling events affected by bortezomib. The combined activity of bortezomib and cetuximab in EGFR- positive solid cancers is unknown, though it is reasonable to postulate that this combination could be synergistic, given the preclinical observations that bortezomib upregulates EGFR expression in cancer cells. Although bortezomib and cetuximab have been studied extensively as single agents, the potential for combining the two agents has not been systematically explored. This Phase I dose-escalation study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination bortezomib and cetuximab, and characterize the preliminary effectiveness of the drug combination in patients with refractory solid tumours expressing EGFR.

None of the haematological toxicities experienced by our patient population were serious (only grade 1/2). In addition, the expected toxicities related to cetuximab were predominantly grade 1 or 2 (skin rash and diarrhoea reported in 81 and 51% of patients, respectively), and these did not worsen in frequency or grade by the addition of bortezomib. In our study, no patient achieved complete or partial response, and only six patients experienced SD for at least 12 weeks. A total of 28 subjects had progressive disease, which is a disappointing outcome. A key finding of our study, which warrants further investigation, is that every patient who achieved a clinical benefit was diagnosed with either cancer of the lungs or head and neck. These responses were seen throughout different dose levels of bortezomib. The identification of another disease marker could possibly enrich the study population with potential responders for subsequent clinical trials of this combination of targeted agents. Recent data of lack of response of K-ras-mutated colorectal tumours to cetuximab (Karapetis et al, 2008) may help rationalise the use of this selection criteria in future studies with bortezomib and cetuximab. Another observation, perhaps not surprising in view of the colorectal data (Chung et al, 2005), is that there was no apparent correlation between patient responses and intensity of EGFR expression. Our goal in requiring EGFR expression was to exclude malignancy without an EGFR target, and thus, patients who would not benefit from cetuximab.

In conclusion, treatment with bortezomib and cetuximab resulted in a tolerable toxicity profile at the highest dose level of bortezomib tested. The MTD was not reached. Although our study tested concomitant administration, the optimal timing of both drugs administration remains to be determined and could be influenced by tumour type.
