Methods: Fifty-seven patients with non-small cell lung cancer received radiotherapy (RT) were eligible. Forty-eight patients with minimum follow-up of 1 year, nine with RILT2 with tumor stage matched to 39 without RILT2, were enrolled for this analysis. Platelet-poor plasma was obtained within 2 weeks before radiother- apy. The plasma proteomes were compared using a multiplexed quantitative proteomics approach involving ExacTag labeling, re- verse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and nano liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spec- trometry. Z scores and Bonferroni-adjusted p values for the two- sample mean comparison were used to identify the differential protein expression between patients with and without RILT2. Results: More than 200 proteins were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. After excluding proteins that were not detected in at least 40% of the 48 patient samples, C4b-binding protein alpha chain and vitronectin had signiﬁcantly higher (p � 0.001 and p � 0.02) expression levels "

Early prediction of RILT would help physicians to stratify patients according to their risk level for toxicity and determine an individualized treatment regimen rather than to use the aver- age radiation tolerance of the whole population. Unfortunately, there are no good predictive markers available to provide an individualized approach. A few small series of studies have shown that transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-�1) is elevated at the end or during the course of radiation, which might be correlated with radiation pneumo- nitis and, therefore, be used as a predictive marker.5–7 Nev- ertheless, the process of radiation damage is a complicated pathophysiological phenomena involving many cells and cy- tokines.7 We hypothesized that a test monitoring more pro- teins together in the blood would estimate the speciﬁc extent of the damage more accurately.

The 80 proteins that were detected in at least 40% of the 48 patient samples were analyzed, based on the sample size and the number of events with weighted consid- eration on the number of proteins and cost of multiple testing. Bonferroni-adjusted p values for these 80 Z scores were used to identify statistically signiﬁcant associations with RTIL2. Predictive analysis was performed using ridged logistic re- gression to adjust for potential errors from multitesting. Cross-validation was used to produce unbiased sensitivity and speciﬁcity estimates, which were displayed as a receiver operating characteristic curve. The logistic regression was based on selection of k proteins based on univariate Z scores, which were calculated internally to the cross-validation.

The patients’ characteristics are listed in Table 1. Lung dosimetric factors such as MLD, V20, and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were not signiﬁcantly different between patients with and without RILT2, largely due to the fact that RT dose prescription was individualized to certain ﬁxed limits of MLD, V20, or NTCP in most patients. Of another note, MLD, V20, and NTCP were sig- niﬁcantly correlated with each other (p � 0.001), we elected MLD as the representative dosimetric parameter of the lung. "

C4BPA21–23 and VTN24–27 are glycoproteins, which play important roles in radiation-induced lung damage. The detailed functions of these proteins are complex and have been summarized previously.17 C4BPA seems to be mainly associated with the inﬂammatory complement pathway, whereas VTN is involved in the ﬁbrotic pathway. The high baseline level of these two proteins may suggest higher sensitivity of an individual to inﬂammatory or ﬁbrotic patho- genesis, thus putting this patient at a higher risk for RILT. Changes in abundance and alternations in glycan com- position of plasma proteins and cell-surface proteins have been shown to correlate with cancer and other disease states. In fact, numerous clinical biomarkers and therapeutic targets are glycosylated proteins, such as CA125 for ovarian cancer and the prostate-speciﬁc antigen for prostate cancer. VTN is a glycoprotein with three N-glycosylation sites identiﬁed.28,29 Sano et al.20 reported that the changes in N-glycosylation of VTN modulate collagen binding during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. As shown in Figure 3, patients with RILT2 might have much higher levels of glycosylated VTN than patients without RILT2. Our future work will focus on glycoproteome analysis of human plasma to ﬁnd more de- tailed information on the glycoproteins, which may be poten- tial biomarkers for RILT2. To reveal the association between our identiﬁed pro- teins and the known pathways for radiation-induced lung damage, we used ingenuity pathway analysis, a knowledge- based system derived from the literature containing informa- tion on interactions between genes, proteins, and other bio- logical molecules, to reveal the associated biological pathways and generate global canonical pathways that are shown to be signiﬁcantly associated with these candidates based on their interactions.30,31 Interestingly, these proteins were in the network of TGF-�1 and interlukin-8 (Figure 5), which are known to play important roles in the molecular mechanism of radiation-induced lung damage.5–7,32 The net- work illustrated implies that C4BPA and VTN have interac- tions with TGF-�1.33,34 Human TGF-�1 increases production of hydrogen peroxide,35 and hydrogen peroxide increases expression of human C4BPA mRNA.36 This network is further supported by our previous ﬁndings that patients with RILT2 also had signiﬁcantly higher plasma TGF-�1 during the course of radiation therapy than those without.32,37 Mul- ticenter studies with a larger number of patients are needed to validate these interesting ﬁndings and to study whether com- bining all these markers together would improve the accuracy of RILT2 prediction. It is interesting that increases in Ig kappa chain V-III region Ti and region HAH are associated with reduced risk of RILT. Ig kappa chain is one type of light chain, which is the small polypeptide subunit of an antibody (or Ig). It takes part in any immune system process that functions in the calibrated response of an organism to a potential internal or invasive "

Nevertheless, there is little literature about chain V-III region Ti38 or region HAH.39 These fragments may have some potential association with RILT protection and are worthy of our further study to identify their mechanism. In summary, this study identiﬁed VTN and C4b-bind- ing protein alpha chain as potential blood biomarkers for RILT2 in patients with NSCLC before RT start. A future independent study with a larger number of patients is needed to validate this result and conﬁrm whether it can improve predictive accuracy from the models (such as MLD) in current use. "
