Results: Seventy-two patients (30 women, 42 men), performance status 0/1 (30/42), and a median age of 63 years were enrolled. Most patients (96%) were current or former smokers. All histologic types were represented (squamous/adenocarcinoma/other: 28%, 42%, 31%). Number of prior regimens: 1: 69%; 2: 26%, and �2: 4%. Median number of cycles administered was (range) 2 (1–12). Tox- icity: grade 3/4 neutropenia was noted in 8.3% with febrile neutro- penia in 1.4%, thrombocytopenia in 8.3%, fatigue in 9.7%, and pneumonia in 11.1%. There were no complete responses, 8.1% had partial response, 56.5% had stable disease, and 35.5% had progres- sive disease as their best response. Twenty-three percent of patients were progression free at 6 months and the median PFS was 2.6 months with an overall survival of 8.1 months. "

However, the study did not achieve its end point of 40% 6-month PFS. The response rate, PFS, and overall survival did not seem markedly different than prior phase II and phase III studies of pemetrexed alone. Consequently, there are no further plans for development of this combination. "

In a randomized trial, docetaxel was improved survival compared with best supportive care and was also demonstrated to be superior to other chemo- therapy regimens (vinorelbine or ifosfamide) in terms of response and landmark survival.1,2 Pemetrexed was shown to be as effective as docetaxel in a randomized trial, with a response rate of 9.1% compared with docetaxel of 8.8%.3 Both agents had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.9 months. Because of a lower incidence of most toxicities, partic- ularly neutropenic fever and hospital admissions, pemetrexed is now commonly used for second-line chemotherapy. The investigational agent, motexaﬁn gadolinium (MGd), disrupts redox-dependent pathways by inhibiting ox- idative stress-related proteins leading to apoptosis.4 MGd selectively targets tumor cells, disrupting energy metabolism and repair mechanisms, rendering cells more prone to apo- ptosis with or without the addition of radiation and chemo- therapy.5 Preclinical studies with MGd and radiation or a wide range of chemotherapy agents including pemetrexed, demonstrated signiﬁcant tumor growth delay in lung cancer cell lines, suggesting potential synergy between the two drugs.6–10 Evidence from phase III trials suggests that there is clinical beneﬁt from the addition of MGd in addition to radiation therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC.11–13 Given the preclinical studies and evidence from clinical trials of the potential efﬁcacy of MGd in NSCLC and synergy with pemetrexed, we designed this pilot phase II open-label trial to "

               "paragraph1": "MGd is a tumor selective anticancer agent with a novel mechanism of action. It has a strong afﬁnity for electrons, meaning that it is easily reduced.4 MGd accepts electrons from various intracellular metabolites and enzymes, such as ascorbate, NADPH, glutathione, and thioredoxin reductase in the presence of oxygen, MGd transfers the electrons to oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, such as superox- ide and hydrogen peroxide, and regenerates the MGd mole- cule by a process referred to as “futile redox cycling.”16 MGd is also able to oxidize protein thiols, which may alter protein structure. As a result of these effects, MGd disrupts cellular metabolism within the cancer cell, inhibiting DNA repair and "

               "paragraph2": "promoting apoptosis. In addition, MGd directly inhibits the activity of thioredoxin reductase.5 MGd selectively accumulates in cancer cells, which has been conﬁrmed in vivo and in patients using magnetic reso- nance imaging scanning to detect the biodistribution of the paramagnetic, Gd (III)-containing complex.17 It is possible that the tumor selectivity demonstrated by MGd is a conse- quence of the altered redox state of these tissues or other factors present in the tumor microenvironment, such as the elevated rates of anaerobic glycolysis, a lowered tissue pH, nutrient supply limitations, and hypoxia. In preclinical models, MGd has been shown to be cytotoxic to some lung cancer cell lines in vitro, both as a single agent and in combination with various chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy. In A549 human lung cancer cells cultured in vitro, MGd is cytotoxic after 12 hours incubation at 50 �M, a concentration achievable in humans. Because of its multifunctional mechanism, cancer cells exposed to MGd may be more vulnerable to many types of oxidative stress including that caused by radiation therapy and chemothe- rapy.7,18 As noted above, MGd has been shown to enhance the in vitro and in vivo effects of a variety of chemothera- peutic agents. The combination of MGd and pemetrexed was studied in lung cancer cell lines both in tissue culture and in an animal xenograft model and demonstrated synergy.6 The primary focus of MGd clinical development has been as a tumor selective radiation enhancement agent.19,20 In a randomized phase III trial of brain metastases (PCYC- 9801), a subset analysis demonstrated improved response, prolonged time to neurologic and neurocognitive progression and function in patients with brain metastases secondary to NSCLC.12 Unfortunately, a phase III conﬁrmatory interna- tional study (PCYC-0211) conﬁned to NSCLC brain metas- tases failed to meet its predeﬁned end point of prolonged time to neurologic progression. However, in the intent-to-treat analysis, MGd exhibited a favorable trend in neurologic outcomes. MGd signiﬁcantly prolonged the interval to neu- rologic progression in NSCLC cancer patients with brain metastases receiving prompt whole brain radiation therapy and reduced the need for salvage brain surgery. The overall negative result appeared to be attributable to an unexpected inﬂuence of treatment delays in radiation therapy.13 MGd has been studied extensively in patients with lung cancer. In a single dose phase I trial, the selective localization of MGd in primary lung cancer, hilar lymph nodes, and other metastatic sites was conﬁrmed using magnetic resonance imaging.19A phase II trial has evaluated MGd as a single agent in progressive NSCLC with evidence of activity in the form of disease stabilization.21 The experience combining MGd with chemotherapy is much more limited. One prior phase I trial combined the agent with docetaxel in advanced solid tumors.22 A phase I trial restricted to NSCLC with docetaxel and cisplatin and MGd demonstrated tolerability, but there was no signiﬁcant improvement of activity.23 Given its excellent tolerability, tumor selectivity and preclinical synergy with pemetrexed, evaluation in combination with pemetrexed was a logical approach. However, despite the ample preclinical data and previous observations demonstrat- "
