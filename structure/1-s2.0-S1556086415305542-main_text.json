Preclinical studies suggested synergic antitumor activity of enzastaurin and pem- etrexed. We conducted this phase I study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of this combination in pa- tients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: An oral daily dose of 500 mg enzastaurin was adminis- tered once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) in combination with 500 mg/m2 pemetrexed on day 1 in repeated 21-day cycles. Cycle 1 started with a 7-day enzastaurin lead-in treatment that preceded pemetrexed administration: a loading dose of 1125 mg enzastaurin on day 1 followed by a 500 mg total daily dose on days 2–7. Results: Twelve patients were treated QD (n � 6) or BID (n � 6). One dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 QTc prolongation) was reported in the QD cohort. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities were slightly increased in the BID cohort compared with the QD cohort. After beginning the combination therapy, enzastaurin exposures decreased slightly but remained above the target plasma concentration of 1400 nmol/L. Compared with QD, there was a higher exposure with BID. The enzastaurin dosing regimen (QD or BID) had no effect on pemetrexed pharmacokinetics. Two patients had partial responses as deﬁned by RECIST. Five patients received more than 10 cycles of treatment without disease progression. Conclusions: Both schedules of enzastaurin in combination with pemetrexed were well tolerated and clinically active in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. "

Platinum-based combination chemotherapy offers a survival beneﬁt in patients with chemo-naïve advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).1,2 Nevertheless, the efﬁ- cacy of platinum-based combination chemotherapy seems to have reached a therapeutic plateau, with a median survival of 8 to 12 months.3,4 Several agents have been approved for second- and third-line therapy, including docetaxel,5,6 pemetrexed7, and erlotinib.8 Nevertheless, they improve survival by only approx- imately 2.2 to 6.5 months compared with best supportive care.5–8 A more effective therapy is needed. Pemetrexed, a multitargeted antifolate, is currently ap- proved as a ﬁrst- and second-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The standard regimen of pemetrexed is 500 mg/m2, administered intravenously (IV) on day 1 in repeated 21-day cycles, supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12. Enzastaurin (LY317615), an oral serine/threonine ki- nase inhibitor, suppress signaling through protein kinase C (PKC)-� and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT path- way.9–12 Enzastaurin is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) to form a desmethylenepyrimidyl metab- olite (LY326020) and a desmethyl metabolite (LY485912), two active metabolites with comparable potency against PKC�. In vitro analysis has shown that the IC90 of enzastaurin for PKC� is 70 nmol/L.9 In light of the 95% plasma protein binding value of enzastaurin, the targeted mean steady state total concentration for clinical efﬁcacy is estimated to be 1400 nmol/L. In a previous dose-escalation study (20–700 mg once daily [QD]) of patients with cancer, enzastaurin exposures reached a plateau above the targeted steady-state plasma concentration of 1400 nmol/L when administered at doses of 525 mg.13 This dose was well tolerated, and enzastaurin at 500 mg QD demonstrated clinical activity as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic agents.14 –17 The combination of enzastaurin and pemetrexed has shown synergic antitumor activity in NSCLC cells.18–20 Pre- "

However, the combination of enzastaurin and pemetrexed signiﬁcantly decrease TS activity and reduced glycogen synthase kinase-3beta/AKT phosphor- ylation and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion.21 Therefore, evidence points to enzastaurin as a promising agent to increase the activity of pemetrexed. In vitro analysis showed that twice daily (BID) dosing could maintain enzastaurin exposures above the targeted plasma concentration longer than QD dosing (data at Eli Lilly on ﬁle), which was conﬁrmed in phase I studies.15,17 We conducted this study to assess safety and tolerability of two dosing regimens of total daily 500 mg enzastaurin (QD or BID) in combination of pemetrexed. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of the combination of enzastaurin and pemetrexed in Japanese ad- vanced NSCLC patients with prior systemic chemotherapy. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the toxicities of this combination and determine the pharmacokinetics of enzastaurin with or without pemetrexed. Antitumor activity of this combi- nation was also assessed. We started with enzastaurin 500 mg QD in combination with pemetrexed to conﬁrm safety in the QD cohorts. After this, we proceeded to 250 mg BID. "

This was continued in cycle 2 and thereafter. Patients received standard pemetrexed as a 10-minute IV dose of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of stage 2 of cycle 1 and subsequently in a repeated 21-day cycle.

Total analyte exposure in cycle 1 was relatively higher than that in cycle 2, suggesting that the loading dose regimen of enzastaurin was instrumental in achieving a steady-state level of total analytes on day 2. PK parameters of pemetrexed for QD and BID dosing are summarized in Table 4. Pemetrexed declined in a tripha- sic manner with an elimination half-life of 3.22 hours, which was consistent with previous observations of pemetrexed single dosing.24 Interpatient variability in CL and Vss was less than 40%, implying constant systemic exposure to pem- etrexed. Pemetrexed pharmacokinetics were not altered by enzastaurin dosing regimen, either QD or BID. "

The combination regimen was well tolerated for both QD and BID dosing. The observed range of grade 3/4 toxicities in this study was consistent with those seen in the monotherapy studies of enzastaurin and pemetrexed. All grade 3/4 toxicities, including DLT, were reversible and manageable. One patient with a history of ischemic heart disease developed grade 3 QTc prolongation that was con- sidered a DLT. However, this event was asymptomatic and "

In the enzastaurin preclinical toxicology study in dogs, prolonged QT and QTc values were observed after 5 weeks of dosing at a high daily dose of enzastaurin. In the enzastaurin phase I study in recurrent glioma patients, one grade 3 QTc prolongation was also reported.33 The PK results of this study indicated no signiﬁcant PK interaction between enzastaurin and pemetrexed, which was consistent with a previously published phase I study report.32 One possible reason for the absence of any effect on phar- macokinetics was the different pathways used for elimina- tion. Pemetrexed is renally eliminated, whereas a phase I study using [14C] enzastaurin indicated that enzastaurin un- dergoes extensive hepatic metabolism with minimal renal elimination (Eli Lilly and Company, Internal Clinical Study "

               "paragraph13": "Report, October 2006). Based on these results, it is not likely that enzastaurin and its metabolites inhibit the renal elimina- tion of pemetrexed. In fact, a previous combination study of enzastaurin with pemetrexed reported by Hanauske et al.17 showed that pemetrexed pharmacokinetics (systemic clear- ance and half-life) did not seem to be altered by enzastaurin. In addition, it is not likely that pemetrexed inhibits the metabolism of enzastaurin by CYP3A4 because results from in vitro studies with human liver microsomes predicted that pemetrexed would not cause clinically signiﬁcant inhibition of metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2.34 In this study, the com- paratively high concentrations observed in cycle 1 resulted from the large loading dose on day 1 of cycle 1. In addition, we conﬁrmed two more ﬁndings that were reported by Hanauske et al.17 First, the maximum concentrations (Cmax,ss) of total analyte in both QD and BID regimens were slightly decreased in the presence of pemetrexed (14% QD and 2% BID in this study; 17% QD and 8% BID in the Hanauske phase Ib study). Second, the average steady-state plasma concentration (Cav,ss) of enzastaurin total analyte was slightly higher in the BID versus QD regimen (20% higher in this study and 11% higher in the Hanauske phase Ib study). In light of the fact that two patients achieved PR, ﬁve patients achieved SD, and ﬁve patients remained on therapy for more than 9 months (13 cycles), the results from this study suggest that the combination of enzastaurin and pem- etrexed might be beneﬁcial in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC. The histology of both the patients who achieved PR was nonsquamous cell carcinoma. One of three patients with squamous cell carcinoma remained on therapy for 14 cycles with SD, whereas PD was observed during cycle 1 for the other two patients. Further research is war- ranted to determine whether enzastaurin might improve the effect of pemetrexed that works preferentially in nonsqua- mous cell carcinoma. "
