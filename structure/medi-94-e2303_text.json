Targeted therapy makes use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to suppress a number of signaling pathways including epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor which are active in NSCLC biology. In this study, we used sunitinib, a multi-target receptor TKI, combined with chemotherapy for unresectable/metastatic NSCLC. This open label Simon’s 2 stage clinical trial enrolled a total of 6 NSCLC patients who received docetaxel (40 mg) and cisplatin (50 mg) on day 1 of each cycle (14 day interval between cycles) and sunitinib (25 mg qd for 10 days between cycles) for a total of 12 cycles (24 weeks), after which patients received maintenance therapy with vinor- elbine (30 mg TIW) until disease progression.

There has been a recent focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms by which targeted therapies inhibit specific pathways involved in tumorigenesis. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib and gefitinib as targeted therapy for NSCLC was based on the discovery that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal- ing is a key event in NSCLC biology, and activating EGFR mutations were strong predictors of response to TKI therapy.10 "

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Medical University Hospital and informed consent was obtained from the patients. All patients received docetaxel (40 mg) and cisplatin (50 mg) on day 1 of each cycle, with a treatment interval of 14 days. All patients received sunitinib (25 mg qd) for a total of 10 days within the 14 day intervals between treatment cycles. Patients were treated for a total of 12 cycles (24 weeks), after which patients received maintenance therapy with vinorelbine (30 mg TIW) until disease progression. The sample size was based on a Simon’s Optimal Two- Stage Design,25 where P0 indicated probability of poor response to the drug, and P1 indicated probability of good response to the drug. For ethical considerations, this design minimizes the expected sample size when the response is P0, and allows recruitment of additional patients when the response is P1. Based on our previous preclinical study, the expected response rate was set as 35% for P0 and as 60% for P1. Using http:// linus.nci.nih.gov/brb/samplesize/otsd.html, the upper limit for the first stage sample size in this study was 6 patients, and diagnosis of a poor response in the second of these 6 patients would lead to early termination of the trial. If not, the trial could progress to Stage II, where the upper limit of the number of patients was 15 (including 6 patients from Stage I). Diagnosis of poor response in the seventh patient of 15 in Stage II would lead to early termination of the study. The significance level alpha ¼ 0.10 and power ¼ 70%. The probability of a poor response (P0) was 0.35, and the probability of early termination at P0 was 0.65. The probability of a good response (P1) was 0.60.

While the safety profile of the 2 regimens were comparable, the combination therapy was shown to signifi- cantly increase the ORR, but not the OS.37 Interestingly, a recent randomized phase II study showed a higher toxicity and lower OS in patients treated with either sunitinib monotherapy or patients treated with a pemetrexed–sunitinib combination compared with patients receiving pemetrexed monotherapy as second-line treatment for advanced NSCLC.38 It is not clear if this could be due to the concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drug. These conflicting reports underline the importance of reaching a consensus on the optimal regimen for patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC. In this study, we used a regimen comprising the multi- target RTK inhibitor, sunitinib, in combination with docetaxel– cisplatin at a lower dosage than is generally used. This was followed by maintenance oral vinorelbine. A previous study recommended the use of a trinomial 2-stage design which treated CRs and PRs separately, since CRs more often confer a survival advantage.39 Our data showed an ORR of 66.67%. One patient had a CR, and 3 patients had a PR by the end of cycle 12. Of the 4 surviving patients, the times to PFS were 22, 27, 19, and 42 months. Four of our 6 study patients have survived over 5 years, and this is dramatically higher compared with previous studies reporting long-term survival data. We suggest that this could be due to the lower doses of the chemotherapeutic drugs used in this study, which could increase the tolerability of the combination regimen. Since the Simon’s Optimal Two-Stage design can use an upper boundary for early termination if a significantly high efficacy is achieved in the first stage,40,41 it was possible to terminate this study early since there was a response rate of 66.7% after the first 6 patients were enrolled. Using the MedCalc software, the 95% CI for ORR ¼ 0.667 was derived as 0.181 to 1.707. However, esti- mation of the 95% CI might be limited because of the small sample size.

Although some phase I studies showed that sunitinib used in combination with cisplatin/gemcitabine or with docetaxel had an acceptable safety profile,42,43 other studies showed higher toxicity in patients treated with sunitinib/pemetrexed combination compared with pemetrexed monotherapy,38 and that sunitinib was not tolerated well in combination with standard doses of pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy.44 In our present study, the combination therapy was well-tolerated, and the most common adverse events were hair loss and anemia and neurological symptoms. The major limitation of this study was patient recruitment. It is difficult to enroll patients in Taiwan because the National Health Insurance pays almost all the costs of targeted therapy for cancer patients. Patients therefore are not motivated to participate in clinical trials. In conclusion, unresectable/metastatic NSCLC patients treated with a combination of sunitinib, docetaxel, and cisplatin followed by maintenance vinorelbine had an ORR of 66.7%. Four patients had an OS of >60 months, and the combination therapy was well tolerated. Larger sample sizes are warranted to validate these results. "
