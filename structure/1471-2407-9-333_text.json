               "paragraph11": "In addition to classic cytotoxic agents, approved systemic therapies to treat NSCLC include inhibitors of the epider- mal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. The EGFR pathway is a principal transducer of growth and survival signals in lung cancer cells and therefore a logical target for therapy. Gefitinib and erlotinib are reversible inhibi- tors of the kinase domain of EGFR that compete with ATP for binding to the catalytic pocket. These small molecules inhibit EGFR autophosphorylation and, thus, they inhibit receptor dimerization, and the downstream signaling that would have otherwise stimulated proliferation (through the activation of Erk) and anti-apoptotic mechanisms (through activation of Akt and Stat). "

               "paragraph12": "TKIs were developed after accumulating evidence indi- cated that a large proportion of NSCLC over-expresses the EGF receptor and is likely to be dependent on this path- way for the malignant phenotype [4]. However, TKIs in NSCLC therapy have not produced the gains in survival and time to progression that were anticipated when used alone or in combination with traditional cytotoxic agents [2,3,5]. Given this limitation, one way to increase the effectiveness of these agents is to rationally select patients based on tumor markers that predict response. "
},
{
               "paragraph13": "The identification of molecular predictors of response to anti-EGFR agents has been difficult. Unlike trastuzumab, whose clinical activity can be predicted by the evidence of over-expression of its target, the ErbB2 receptor, either by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or immunohis- tochemistry (IHC) [6], single markers have not produced accurate predictive models of response for anti-EGFR agents such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Early results on the relationship between EGFR protein overexpression or egfr gene amplification and response were contradictory and recent large studies indicate that there is no correlation between high EGFR expression by IHC or amplification by FISH and better response to TKIs [5,7-9]. Specific muta- tions in the egfr gene have correlated with the dramatic responses that are sometimes seen in a small percentage of patients treated with these agents. However, these results are confounded by the prognostic value of the mutations, since it has been noted that these patients have a better prognosis, regardless of treatment used, than patients whose tumors do not bear egfr mutations [10]. Moreover, the mutations do not identify the large number of patients that achieve more modest responses. "

We subsequently analyzed tumor tissue from a subgroup of these patients for a pilot study to evaluate the utility of a combination of markers, downstream from the inactivated EGFR receptor, to predict response to TKIs and correlate outcomes. We based our design on the hypothe- sis that an accurate predictive model may need several markers, and that markers closer to the malignant pheno- type (activated, phosphorylated proteins) may be better predictors than DNA/RNA markers or inactive (unphos- phorylated) protein markers. In order to determine which tumor will be susceptible to anti-EGFR therapy, one may need to assess the level of phosphorylated EGFR as well as the level of phosphorylated downstream mediators, Akt, Erk1/2 and Stat3, the cytosolic end points to the three branches of the EGFR signaling pathway. Moreover, clini- cal data have identified these markers as relevant to the natural history of lung cancer [11-15]. "

Recorded variables included age, sex, smoking history, ECOG performance status score, date of diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, treatments, and toxicities. Outcome data included best response, time to progression, survival since start of TKI treatment, and overall survival. Best response to the new therapeutic agent was documented in the first computed tomography (CT) scans done 3-4 months after the start of TKI therapy. Time to progression was defined as the time interval from the initiation of TKI therapy to the time of disease progression as evidenced by CT scan or by a decline in performance status. Survival since TKI treatment was defined as the time interval from initiation of TKI therapy to death. "

Primary antibodies were visualized with biotinylated secondary antibodies, streptavidin/HRP enzyme complex and DAB chromogen. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Total EGFR levels were obtained from sections sent to NorDx Laboratories and stained on a Ventana BenchMark XT automated stainer using anti-EGFR mouse monoclonal antibody 3C6 and Basic DAB Detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems, Tuc- son, AZ, USA). Protocols were pre-tested using positive and negative control cell pellets for each anti-phospho protein antibody, available through Cell Signaling Tech- nologies. Sections were scanned at low magnification and portions containing tumor tissue were delineated by the study pathologist (PA). Specimens were evaluated by light microscopy by two independent observers and scored based on a semiquantitative approach of percentage of positive tumor cells (0-100%), multiplied by staining intensity (0 = negative, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong). In cases in which there were tumor cell popula- tions within one sample with clear distinction in staining intensities, each region's intensity was multiplied by the appropriate percentage and added to produce the sample score. The final percentage of cells staining and score for each slide was calculated as the average between the per- centage and scores of the two observers. For example, a sample that was scored by one observer as having 100% of cells staining, with 50% of them staining at intensity 1 and 50% at intensity 2, and was scored by the second observer as having 80% of cells staining, with 70% of them staining at intensity 1 and 10% at intensity 2, would receive a score of 150 [(50 Ã 1) + (50 Ã 2)] from observer one, and a score of 90 [(70 Ã 1) + (10 Ã 2)] from observer two. Accordingly, in this sample, the final percentage of cells staining would be 90% (mean between 100% and 80%), and the final score would be 120 (mean between 150 and 90). In this manner, a total score range of 0-300 was generated for each sample, where 0 was classified as no expression, 1-10 was classified as low expression, 11- 100 was classified as moderate and 101-200 was classified as moderate-high expression level, and scores over 200 were classified as high expression level. The distribution of staining (membranous, cytoplasmic, or nuclear) was recorded. Positive expression of pERK1/2 in stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells of tumor tissue was used as an internal standard of tissue quality and antigen pres- ervation. "

We found no discerna- ble association between TTP and the level of total EGFR. On the other hand, we found a positive association between TTP and the level of pEGFR: in general, the higher the level of this protein, the longer the TTP. Patients with no discernable pEGFR signal had a median TTP of 2.0 months while patients with moderate pEGFR levels had a mean TTP of 3.5 months (Figures 5a-b). pAkt and, to a lesser extent, pStat3 were also slightly positively associated with longer TTP (Figures 5c-d). In contrast, phosphorylated Erk1/2 displayed a negative association with TTP: the higher the level of this protein, the shorter the TTP. Patients with little or no detectable levels of pErk1/2 had a median TTP of 4.2 months while patients with high levels of pErk1/2 had a mean TTP of 0.6 months (Figure 5e). When the levels of the four phospho-proteins were compared amongst each other, we found a strong positive correlation between the level of pEGFR and the level of pStat3 that reached statistical significance (p < 0.0001).

In this study, we also found that the appearance of rash correlated with longer TTP and survival with TKI treatment. In addition, we found that patients who achieved some degree of disease control at the first response evaluation had a significantly better outcome than patients who experienced disease progression.

          "paragraph2": "Although early clinical indicators of response are useful, the identification of pre-treatment predictors of benefit would be even more desirable. We hypothesized that tumors that are actively using the EGFR pathway for sur- vival and growth would be most susceptible to TKI ther- apy-mediated inhibition. We also hypothesized that the activation status of the EGFR pathway could be assessed by evaluating the phosphorylation level of key members of the pathway, rather than total protein levels. Accord- ingly, we determined the expression levels of the activated receptor (pEGFR), and the activated cytosolic end points to the three branches of the EGFR pathway (pAkt, pStat3 and pErk1/2) in pre-treatment samples of tumor tissue from patients undergoing TKI therapy and response assessment.

This reflects the fact that the phospho-proteins are more labile and more difficult to detect than total protein levels [17]. In agreement with this, we found that the signal from phosphorylated antigens was more prominent in tumor cells located toward the periphery of the tissue blocks as opposed to cells in more internal regions. We presume that the time delay that occurs from the immersion of the block in fixative to its complete permeation results in the observed pattern of expression. Interestingly, when we compared the levels of the four phospho-proteins amongst each other, we found a significant correlation between the level of pEGFR and pStat3, in general agree- ment with the notion that the activation of the receptor gets transduced most directly to pStat3 in the signaling pathway.

However, the small number of samples precluded obtaining statistically significant results. Higher levels of pEGFR, pAkt, and pStat3 were associated with longer TTP, while higher levels of pErk1/2 were associated with shorter TTP. These results make biologic sense given the presumed position of these proteins in the pathway. pAkt and pStat are thought to mediate cell survival, and it "
